I hate you for what you did
And I miss you like a little kid
I faked it every time
But that's alright
I can hardly feel anything
I hardly feel anything at all
You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist
I only went one time
You let it slide
Fell on hard times a year ago
Was hoping you would let it go, and you did
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back
In the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did
I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language
I could scream to drown you out
Hey, why do you sing with an English accent?
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it
But I will try to drown you out
You said when you met me, you were bored
You said when you met me, you were bored
And you, you were in a band when I was born
I have emotional motion sickness
I try to stay clean and live without
And I want to know what would happen
If I surrender to the sound
Surrender to the soundNoneNoneNoneNone
Sometimes I think I'm a killer
I scared you in your house
I even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch
But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus, I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
And faking sleep to count your breath
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Or is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do
But when I'm sick and tired
And when my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair
I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And I've given all my love
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do
Georgia, Georgia, I love your son
And when he gets older, he might be the one
He might be the one
Georgia, Georgia, he has beautiful bones
And he never lies or picks up his phone
And sometimes in the pouring rain
He'll fall in the mud and get back up again
And if you find me, will you know me?
Will you take me, or will you fall?
Here is my day plan, here's my new machine
He is a fine new addition, so young and so clean
So young and so clean
He came up through the water without a sound
With my back to the shoreline, I dreamt that he drowned
I dreamt that he drowned
And sometimes, when he looks at me
I know he needs you, you're all that he sees
And if I breathe you, will it kill me?
Will you have me, or watch me fall?
If I fix you, will you hate me?
And would you fuck this and let us fall?
Day off in Kyoto
Got bored at the temple
Looked around at the 7-Eleven
The band took the speed train
Went to the arcade
I wanted to go, but I didn't
You called me from a payphone
They still got payphones
It costs a dollar a minute
To tell me you're getting sober
And you wrote me a letter
But I don't have to read it
I'm gonna kill you
If you don't beat me to it
Dreaming through Tokyo skies
I wanted to see the world
Then I flew over the ocean
And I changed my mind (Woo)
Sunset's been a freak show
On the weekend, so
I've been driving out to the suburbs
To park at the Goodwill
And stare at the chem trails
With my little brother
He said you called on his birthday
You were off by like ten days
But you get a few points for tryin'
Remember getting the truck fixed
When you let us drive it
25 felt like flying
I don't forgive you
But please don't hold me to it
Born under Scorpio skies
I wanted to see the world
Through your eyes until it happened
Then I changed my mind
Guess I lied
I'm a liar
Who lies
'Cause I'm a liarNone
Playing "would you rather"
When it comes to fire
You always say that you'd prefer to drown
You were still in the ambulance
When the cop suggested you're the one
Who tried to burn it down
Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We found our way out
Of the suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background, I'll be waiting
We have the same face
I laid awake as someone shoved you
Up against a wall
Quarantined in a bad dream
He's half the man
And you're twice as tall
Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We found our way out
Of the suicide pact of our family and friends
In the background, I'll be waiting
Next time I see you, you'll show me
A hundred different ways to say the same things
Come to find out
I'm a can on a string, you're on the end
We found our way out
Of the suicide pact of our family and friends
And when you touchdown, I'll be waving
Sometimes I think I'm a killer
Scared you in your house
Even scared myself by talking
About Dahmer on your couch
But I can't sleep next to a body
Even harmless in death
Plus I'm pretty sure I'd miss you
Faking sleep to count your breath
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
Is there nothing left to do for us?
I am sick of the chase
But I'm hungry for blood
And there's nothing I can do
But when I'm sick and tired
When my mind is barely there
When a machine keeps me alive
And I'm losing all my hair
I hope you kiss my rotten head
And pull the plug
Know that I've burned every playlist
And given all my love
Can the killer in me
Tame the fire in you?
I know there's something waiting for us
I am sick of the chase
But I'm stupid in love
And there's nothing I can do
And there's nothing I can do
Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Just a memory of a kid, just a washed out finish
Just a pain-in-the-ass Johnny Cash middle finger
No shooting up drugs, no quitter is a winner
Nothing ever comes like it did when you were in it
Keeping nothing for yourself like a stone cold killer
Now you're passing your people like a ship in the night
Looking to every stranger for a fight
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
Hoping that you like, that you like how you're living
Relying on the kindness of strangers that you will be forgiven
How many times, how many times will you shit on what you're given?
How many times, how many times 'til you shut up and listen?
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth, your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
Nothing ever comes, ever comes
Choking like a dog, like a dog
Open up your mouth
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
Nothing ever comes, ever comes if you call it
Choking like a dog, like a dog on a collar
Open up your mouth if you want it
Listen for the sound, the sound, the sound is coming down
For a chemical imbalance
You sure know how to ride a train
Your revolution is a deathbed
And the music is your maid
When someone comes a-knockin'
With a needle on a tray
Only your lonesome lies beside you
For you told me not to stay
You are somebody's baby
Some mother held you near
No, it's not important, they're just pretty words, my dear
There is no distraction that can make me disappear
No, there's nothing that won't remind you
I will always be right here
And you spit the blood back
Spit the blood back, baby
I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home with you tonight
We're both very sick, our muscles are worn down
It's as if we are one-hundred, know I won't still be around
Because I've fallen
Yes, I've fallen right into the love I've found
Long before I reach one-hundred
I'll have fallen to the ground
And for generations, they'll romance us, make us more
Or much less than ever was before
The Chelsea and the floor
Make us stand before the masses
Like two speakers for the poor
When there was no revolution
Nothing we were fighting for
And you spit the blood back
Spit the blood back, baby
I'm amazed that you're alright
Oh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home, I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight
And you can call the service bell
When we stay at the Chelsea Hotel
And I'll stay out of my own hell
Oh, so long, prison boy
I won't be home, I won't be home
I won't be home with you tonight
TonightNoneNone
Laying down on the lawn
I'm tired of trying to get in the house
I'm thinking out loud
I've been playing dead my whole life
And I get this feeling whenever I feel good
It'll be the last time
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you
If you're a work of art, I'm standing too close
I can see the brush strokes
I hate your mom
I hate it when she opens her mouth
It's amazing to me how much you can say
When you don't know what you're talking about
But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something when I see you
I used to light you up
Now I can't even get you to play the drums
'Cause I don't know what I want
Until I fuck it up


But I feel something when I see you now
I feel something


I'll climb through the window again
But right now it feels good not to stand
Then I'll leave it wide open
Let the dystopian morning light pour inNone
Comin' back from the country
For the good food and lousy beer
This winter's so dry and the dirt road so dusty
At the lightest fall of rain, the bacteria bloom


You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it


Tethered to a table with that happy holiday crowd
And it's anchors aweigh
Looks like smooth sailin'
But the merest hint of waves could capsize you


You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it


The desire for annihilation
Is as common as it is unkind
And it's hard to recognize the situation
When you're desperately tryin' to have a good time


You don't have to be alone to be lonesome
It's easy to forget
The sadness comes crashin' like a brick through the window
And it's Christmas so no one can fix it


Yeah, it's Christmas
So no one can fix itNoneNoneThere's a valley of sorrow in my soul
Where every night I hear the thunder roll
Like the sound of a distant gun
Over all the damage I have done

And the shadows filling up this land
Are the ones I built with my own hand
There is no comfort from the cold
Of this valley of sorrow in my soul

There's a river of darkness in my blood
And through every vein I feel the flood
I can find no bridge for me to cross
No way to bring back what is lost

Into the night it soon will sweep
Down where all my grievances I keep
But it won't wash away the years
Or one single hard and bitter tear

And the rock of ages I have known
Is a weariness down in the bone
I used to ride it like a rolling stone
Now I just carry it alone

There's a highway risin' from my dreams
Deep in the heart I know it gleams
For I have seen it stretching wide
Clear across to the other side

Beyond the river and the flood
And the valley where for so long I've stood
With the rock of ages in my bones
Someday I know it will lead me home. oh, oh, oh...NoneNoneNoneNoneHave yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
Next year all our troubles will be out of sight

Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Make the Yuletide gay
Next year all our troubles will be miles away

Once again as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Will be near to us, once more

Someday soon we all will be together
If the fates allow
Until then we'll to muddle through somehow
So have yourself a merry little Christmas now

So have yourself a merry little Christmas now
I've got a surgeon's precision and a drunk man's hand
They say I've stopped growin', so I do what I can
Nothin' ever changes but the cigarette brand
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine


You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt
You don't got blame on your breath
God bless, but all I taste is guilt
Ooh


Misery will bury you
I'm so sorry if I'm scarin' you
What was I supposed to do
As opposed to lovin' you?


I've got a surgeon's hand and a drunk man's passion
Totally limbless and I'm ready for action
Nothin' ever changes but the taste of tobacco
But don't panic, it's just routine
Don't panic, this is just routine


You've got roses on the brain, and I'm all wilt
You've got snowflakes in your veins, and I'm all melt

You gave me fifteen hundred
To see your hypnotherapist

I have emotional motion sickness
Somebody roll the windows down
There are no words in the English language

I'm on the outside looking through
You're throwing rocks around your room
And while you're bleeding on your back in the glass
I'll be glad that I made it out
And sorry that it all went down like it did

Why do you sing with an English accent?
I guess it's too late to change it now
You know I'm never gonna let you have it

        I miss the drip in the back of my throat
Sometimes I miss my bloody nose
Two heads underwater, together we drowned
But nothing feels better when you're coming down
Nothing feels better when you're coming down

There's nothing that I won't believe
Waves are crashing over me
When a beautiful voice makes an awful sound
Well nothing feels worse when you're coming down
Nothing feels worse when you're coming down

He said "I need air, I need space"
One of us will die in this place
I see the fire through these clouds
I'll never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down
Never have to feel it if I never come down

No mirrors on the table
No cab to Chelsea Hotel
When it's freezing cold and I'm not able to tell

I see the rooftops disappear
How did I end up down here?
Am I falling asleep or blacking out?
Need you here if I ever come down
Need you here if I ever come down

It's the first time in months I've slept the whole night
You never once left my bedside
But don't you worry about me now
Just hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Hold my hand and lay me down
Nothing feels better when you're coming downNone

I'm staying in tonight
I won't stop you from leaving
I know that I'm not what you wanted, am I?
Wanted someone who I used to be like
Now you think I'm not trying
I don't argue, it's not worth the effort to lie
You don't want to bring it up
And I already know how it looks
You don't have to remind me so much
How I disappoint you
Suggest that I talk to somebody again
That knows how to help me get better
And 'til then I should just try not to miss any more
Appointments


I think if I ruin this
That I know I can live with it
Nothing turns out like I pictured it
Maybe the emptiness is just a lesson in canvases
I think if I fail again
That I know you're still listening
Maybe it's all gonna turn out all right
And I know that it's not, but I have to believe that it is


I have to believe that it is
I have to believe that it is
(I have to believe it, I have to believe it)
I have to believe that it is
(Probably not, but I have to believe that it is)


And when I tell you that it is
Oh, it's more for my benefit
Maybe it's all gonna turn out all right
Oh, I know that it's not, but I have to believe that it isI know you're sleeping by now
But I'm still up walking around
The walls of my skull bend backwards
And in like a labyrinth

And I knew I was wasting my time
Keep myself awake at night
'Cause whenever I close my eyes
I'm chasing your tail lights
In the dark
In the dark
In the dark

And I know you left hours ago
I still haven't moved yet
I knew you were gone months ago
But I can't think of anyone else

I should have said something, something, something
But I couldn't find something to say
So I just said nothing, nothing, nothing
Sat and watched you drive away

And I just let the parking lot swallow me up
Choking your tires, and kicking up dust
Asking aloud why you're leaving
But the pavement won't answer me

And I just let the silence swallow me up
The ring in my ears tastes like blood
Asking aloud why you're leaving
I know you won't answer me

I know I meant nothing, nothing to you
But I thought I meant something, something, something
But I just said nothing, said nothing, said nothing
Sat and watched you drive away

Oh I just said nothing, said nothing, said nothing
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
I can't think of anyone, anyone else
No, I won't think of anyone elseAll of my friends live in a plastic bag
Walking around, jumping the train tracks
Over the fence, veins all black
Sleep on a bench in the park
On my birthday
Call the blue lights
Cursed your name
When I find I'm still awake

Give me everything good, and I'll throw it away
I wish I could quit but I can't stand the shakes
Choking to smoke, or singing your praise
But I think there's a God and He hears either way
When I rejoice
And complain
I never know what to say

But I think there's a God and He hears either way
When I rejoice
And complain
Lift my voice
That I was made
And somebody's listening at night
With the ghosts of my friends when I pray
Asking "Why did you let them leave
And then make me stay?"
Know my name
And all of my hideous mistakes

I rejoice
I rejoice
I rejoice
I rejoiceNoneNone
There's a hole in the drywall still not fixed
I just haven't gotten around to it
And besides I'm starting to get used to the gaps

Say you wish you could find some way to help
Not to be so hard on myself
So why is it easy for everyone else?
I'm not always like this
There's always tomorrow I guess


And I'd never do it but it's not a joke
I can't tell the difference when I'm all alone
Is it real or a dream, which is worse?
Can you help me?
I just wanted to go to sleep


(When I turn out the lights)
When I turn out the lights
There's no one left
Between myself and me


But when I turn out the lights
When I turn out the lights
When I turn out the lights, oh
There's no one left
Between myself and meYour long hair – a short walk
My biggest fear and a slow watch
In the thin air, my ribs creak
Like wooden dining chairs when you see me
Always scared that every situation ends the same
With a blank stare
Me and the tap water circling the sink drain
Because it's heavy, but I'm trying really hard
To keep my nose clean, and the blue out of my arms
But it's not easy

It's not easy when what you think of me is important
And I know it shouldn't be so damn important
But it is to me
And I'm only ever screaming at myself in public
I know I shouldn't act this way in public
I know I shouldn't make my friends all worry
When I go out at night
And grind my teeth like sutures, my mouth like a wound
When I stay up and throw my voice about you
Or less about you and more about
How I ruin everything I think could be good newsNoneNoneBorn cutting teeth on the curb
Summoning ghosts up from the concrete
Keep me company while I learn
Shadowboxing with giants
That grew from our feet

I know that you don't understand
'Cause you don't believe what you don't see
When you watch me throwing punches at the devil
Ooh, it just looks like I'm fighting with me

But there's a comfort in failure
Singing too loud in church
Screaming my fears into speakers
'Til I collapse or I burst
Whichever comes first

I know you were trying to help
But you're only making it worse
Tell me that I shouldn't blame myself
But you can't even imagine how badly it hurts
Just to think sometimes
How I think almost all the time

So break me down
Folded over your arms
Like an unloaded shotgun
Dismantled and harmless
Even you couldn't manage to pull
The fuse from the back of my head

When you tell me you love me
Tell me you loved me
I wanted so bad to believe it
So tell me you love me
Tell me you loved me
I wanted so bad
I wanted so bad to believe you
I used to never wear a seatbelt
'Cause I said I didn't care
What happened
And I didn't see the point
In trying to save myself
From an accident
'Cause if somebody's gonna help me
What's this fabric gonna help?
And when I'm pitched through the windshield
I hope the last thing that I felt before the pavement
Was my body float
I hope my soul goes too


I shouldn't have let you leave
I should have called you twice
But I didn't
'Cause it's always something else
And I know it's a bad time
But there's no one left for me to call
And I was wondering if you would be my ride
And damn it, we are gonna figure something out
If it takes me all night to make it hurt less


Leave the car running
I'm not ready to go
It doesn't matter where
I just don't want to be alone
And as long as you're not tired yet
Of talking, it helps to make it hurt less


Oh, leave the car running
I'm not ready to go
And it doesn't matter where
I just don't want to be alone
And as long as you're not tired yet
Of talking, it helps to make it hurt less


This year I've started wearing safety belts
When I'm driving
Because when I'm with you
I don't have to think about myself
And it hurts lessThe low, electric glow – static snows in the lobby
Dull TV, magazines, waiting rooms can't hide me
From the sting, paper sheets, bloodwork and the IV
And the whirring machines while the nurses reassure me:
This will be quick and easy, I'm not gonna feel a thing
Lie and say it'll be alright, like a stray falling asleep
'Cause I'm so good at hurting myself

Pulse is slow, faint metronome on my left side
Beneath my protruding spine
You can hardly hear at night
White flag, blindfold covering my sunken eyes
And a line of rifles aimed at my sick mind

'Cause I'm so good at hurting myselfNoneI wake up with the same pain every night
Digging a hatchet into my left side
Clearing my chest of something to burn
Ash for a decorative urn you keep in your mantelpiece;
Like a trophy for everything
That withers eventually

Call me a coward, but I'm too scared to leave
'Cause I want you to be the last thing I see
C'mon, call me a coward, because I'm too scared to leave
Watched you pouring lighter fluid out onto the leaves

And I would've loved you with the dying fire
Let you smother me down to the embers
Frostbite turning my limbs as black as cinder of funeral pyre

And I would have stayed if you'd asked me to
Stood outside till my lips turn blue
I wouldn't have blamed you
For leaving me there on the porch while you drank gasoline
'Cause it's what you needed so bad

And it's true
It's nothing that we could doTell me in thin paper about your love
Breath like thick water lives in my lungs
My skin is full of black ink, in your white clothes
For so much I think, little I know

Pull off my armor, knees bruised and naked
Peel back my skin, call out my name
Vessel of brightness, come make me blind
This present darkness is swallowed by light

And my skeleton is a house for my eyes
Purchased with a bleeding sideNone
My heart is gonna eat itself
I don't need anybody's help
It's just me, the vacant and nobody else
At least that's what I tell myself


'Cause I'm an amputee, with a phantom touch
Leaning on an invisible crutch
Pinned to the mattress like an insect to styrofoam
Calling out from my bedroom alone


And I know what's in my cannibal chest
That's been dug out like a strip mine till there's nothing left
Hold the chorus in between my ears until I go deaf
That remind me exactly what I am every chance they get


Am I a masochist
Screaming televangelist
Clutching my crucifix
Of white noise and static
All my prayers are just apologies
Hold out a flare until you come for me
Do I turn into light if I burn alive
When is it too many times
To tell you that I think of you every night
I don't want to make it hard on you
So I could be cruel
Yeah I could make you hate me
Would that make it easy
Did you think I forgot
The fireworks, the black eye
Trading blows on the fourth of July
But you were right, I was asking for it
I always am
It's no good if the pain doesn't make you feel like you earned it
And I probably deserved it


'Cause all you ever say is
"What's the point; is anybody there to help me now"
It's not that I think I'm good
I know that I'm evil
I guess I was trying to even it out


Isn't that what you want
For me to be miserable like you
Well brother, you're about to get your wish
Putting my fist through the plaster in the bathroom of a Motel 6
I must have pictured it all a thousand times
I swear to God I think I'm gonna die
I know you were right
I can't be fixed, so help me


'Cause all you ever say is
"What's the point; is anybody there to help me now"
It's not that I think I'm good
I know that I'm evil
I guess I was trying to even it outNoneNoneNoneNoneNone
Went back home in the winter
Moved into my parents’ house
And walked the hallways like a stranger
Still haven’t figured anything out


‘Cause I still don’t know what to do
Last year, I swore I’d make a noose in the lights
Hang out in the gutter
Decorate my neck with the colored bulbs
So that everyone would laugh at me
Laugh at me
Laugh at me
When you drive around the neighborhood in your SUV
Looking for a holiday display with your family
And there I’ll be, in the yard, dangling


Happier spending December
Fulfilling obligations
Without the red pin in my calendar
Or last call at the Greyhound station


‘Cause I can’t hurry up to you
End of every grueling day
And for the mundanity we suffer through
I won’t try to join the pile up on the freeway
Crash my car into a ditch, oh darling
I won’t even think of it… anymore


‘Cause I loved you
I loved you
I loved you
More than I hate me
I hate me
I hate me


I loved you
I loved you
I loved you
More than I hate me
I hate me
I hate me


I loved you
I loved you
I loved you
More than I hate me
I hate me
I hate me


I loved you
I loved you
I loved you
More than I hate me
I hate me
I hate meNonePlease don’t look at me that way
Your eyes are so heavy and I’m not that interesting
If I had it my way I would be a ghost
And abandon the white sheet
God, it’s so hard to be seen

Think I’d like to be invisible
Become one with the living room wallpaper at your party
Wouldn’t mind disappearing
But you always say you would miss me
Who am I kidding?
Even if I meant it
I’d probably still visit
I know how you hate to be lonely
I could float around and rearrange objects
To a conversation piece

Come back as anyone else, a better version of myself
A costumed monstrosity
And it already feels when you hold me
That your hands could pass right through my body
So do you think when I die I’d get a second try?
To do everything right I couldn’t the first time?If I could do what I want, I’d become an electrician
I’d crawl inside my ears and I’d rearrange the wires in my brain
A different me would be inhabiting this body
Have two cars, a garage, a job, and I would go to church on Sunday

A diagram of faulty circuitry explains how I was made
Now the engineer is listening as I voice all my complaints
From an orchestra of shaking metal, keeping me awake
I was just wondering if there’s any way that you made a mistake?

‘Cause I miss you the way that I miss nicotine
If it makes me feel better, how bad can it be?
Well, I heard there’s a fix for everything
Well then why, then why, then why, then why not me?

The first of April saw the sick and in repair
Wore my best shirt to the clinic, decorated with the laminate name
No one is laughing from an audience of folding plastic chairs
And I’m not fooled when you tell me that you’re glad I came

Am I honest to admit I’m just a hypocrite?
I know I should be being optimistic, but I’m doubtful I can change
Grit my teeth and try to act deserving
When I know there is nowhere I can hide from your humiliating grace

‘Cause if you swear that it’s true, then I have to believe
What I hear evangelicals say on TV
God, if there’s enough left after everyone else
Then why, then why, then why, then why not me?NoneNoneNoneNone
Your hands are folded
Your eyes are closing
Your words are broken
Your eyes are dry


I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust


You are your mother's child
You're a mother of a mother of a mother now
Raised in the age of the milkman
I can't claim to understand


I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust


Lord, prepare me
For the shadows
For the sparrows
At my window
Lord, have mercy
On my descendants
For they know not what they do
For they know not who you are, Lord
And they know not what to do


I, the anchor, am slowly sinking
Into darkness yet unknown
But the fading light around me
Is full of faces who carry my name


I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust


Lord, be near me
My final hour
I once had sight
But now I'm blind
Oh, I tried to be
A second coming
And if I was
Nobody knew
If my throat can't sing
Then my soul screams out to you!


I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dust
I'm weak looking at you, a pillar of truth, turning to dustNoneNoneNoneNoneNone
I'm a ghost walking in a boring dream
You are there talking and I'm not listening
I am busy doing nothing and you're rudely interrupting

It's a myth and now I see it clearly
You don't have to be sad to make something worth hearing
Now I'm common and content, one more burden off my back


You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand


I'm a ghost walking on an empty street
No name anymore, no need to call for me
I'm a long-lost hometown hero
Latent legendary past lives within me

If I had the offer to do it again
Make me invincible, invisible, or brain dead
If the body and the life were two things that we could divide
I'd deliver up my shell to be filled with somebody else


You don't wanna be a creator
Doesn't mean you've got nothing to say
Put down the pen, don't let it force your hand

You don't wanna be a leader
Doesn't mean you don't know the way
Hold your own hand, walk on without a plan
We woke up to the thunder
We huddled under covers
We didn't say anything
If you hadn't come over
I would be so much colder
I would be much less confused


And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say
Could not believe my eyes
I could not recognize
Your face in the rubble


Without you, I am surely the last of our kind
Without you, I am surely the last of my kind


We had a lot to measure
We had more past than pleasure
And time grows deep like weeds
You catch me when I'm falling
Sometimes, I wish you wouldn't
I can't tell if I'm learning


And then the water came
And washed it all away
It left me with nothing to say

Without you I am surely the last of my kind
Without you I am surely the last of our kind

Longing for your short hair to grow back to the way you like
Thank you for the gesture
I regret ever implying that you could be better
Didn't mean to empty your perfect body
And fill it with my passing whim


Easily won, weary of losing
Gullible girl, weak and alluring
Will we break our rules, get drunk in the dark
Laughing aloud at the spinning stars?


Believe me, I'm speaking plainly and painfully
Trying to stay elegant, eloquent and delicate to you
I see you holding your breath with your arms outstretched
Waiting for someone to come rip open your chest
You take me aside
To solemnly confide
When it comes the time
You plan to give your body to the flameNoneNoneNoneNoneOh please, don't make fun of me
Of my crooked smile and my crowded teeth
Of my pigeon feet, of my knobby knees
Well, I got more problems than not

But I feel fine and I made up my mind
To live happily, feeling beautiful beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core
Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh you know I get frightened so easily
When I'm all alone and the floorboards creak
It's those noises in the dark

But I am alive and I made up my mind
To live fearlessly, running wild beneath the trees
Above a ground that's solid at the core

Send my regards to the north my friends
I am built for the heat, I regret to admit
My fear of freezing keeps me on my feet
And so far my whole life's one long lucky streak
They say you should take the credit when it comes
But I believe in haunted wood

Oh please, don't make fun of me
Oh I'll try my best to tell it like it is
But I'll bite my tongue and I'll close my lips
When nobody wants to hear it

But here we are and something about it doesn't feel like an accident
We're all looking for something to adore
And how to survive the bending and breaking

I've walked on two legs since I was a child
But when did I realize that some ways out
Past the horizon for thousands of miles
There are people like me, walking on legs like mine?

Coming closer and farther away
Coming to me and from my embrace
Hoping good comes from good
And good comes from bad anyway

Oh please, don't make fun of me
With my heart of gold and my restless soul
Oh please, don't make fun of me
This smile happens genuinely

If you want to see the world, you have to say goodbye
'Cause a map does no good hanging on a wall
If you want to see the world, you have to say goodbye

Slow dancing
At low tide, low tide
Drawn to move
By the moon, by the moon


And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time


Slow motion
In double time, double time
You are all
I can't deny


And I see the seat next to yours is unoccupied
And I was wondering if you'd let me come and sit by your side
I've got plenty of affection
I'd be glad to show you some time


What am I supposed to do
With you in the room?
What am I supposed to say
With your green eyes on my red face?
With your green eyes on my red faceI set a fire on the stove
And fed it every word I wrote
I watched my journals turn to smoke
Now all there is is what I spoke

I decided long ago
To make the most of what I know
And worry not of what I don't
Perfect the art of letting go

'Cause if I trust in something else
Then I don't need to trust myself
I've learned a lot since I began
But I think I was wiser then

I've done too much and not enough
In trying to put you above
I cannot tell if I'm in love
Or whose regard I'm thinking of

If beauty is the only way
To make the nightmares go away
I'll plant a garden in your brain
And let the roots absorb the pain

I set a fire to my soul
I hope it ate til it was full
I set a fire to my soul
It burned me and it made me whole
I'm taking back roads
All the way back home
Everything I’ve known
Just a little overgrown
I didn't choose this town
I can't undo it now
I try to love the beast
No matter what it thinks of me

You’re worried that you'll go to hell
For all the lives that you can't save
For all the money that you waste
For all the good you throw away


Yes, you're evil but you're not that bad
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said "forget the past"
Let your flag fly at forever half mast
Let your flag fly at forever half mast


We're in a state of disarray
United by our darkest days
Aching from the growing pains
They always say it's just a phase
America, the tried and true
Red and white and black and blue
Tell me, who did this to you?
If it was me, I hardly knew


Yes, you're evil but you’re not that bad
You put out your palm more than the back of your hand
They were wrong when they said "forget the past"
Let your flag fly at forever half mast
Let your flag fly at forever half mast


All for one and one for all
Nobody escaped the fall
Wait for something magical
Mistake turned into miracleNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneLast night I stood at your doorstep
Trying to figure out what went wrong
You slipped something into my palm and you were gone

I could smell the deep green of summer
'Bove me the same night sky was glowin'
In the distance I could see the town where I was born

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
A long walk home

In town I pass Sal's grocery
Barbershop on old South Street
I looked in their faces
They're all rank strangers to me
Well Veteran's Hall high upon the hill
Stood silent and alone
The diner was shuttered and boarded
With a sign that just said "gone"

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home


Everybody has a neighbor
Yeah everybody has a friend
Yeah everybody has a reason to begin again

My father said "Son, we're lucky in this town
It's a beautiful place to be born
It just wraps its arms around you
Nobody crowds you and nobody goes it alone"

"Your flag flyin' over the courthouse
Means certain things are set in stone
Who we are what we'll do and what we won't"

It's gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
Hey pretty darling, don't wait up for me
Gonna be a long walk home
It's gonna be a long walk home

I'm the boy in your other phone
Lighting up inside your drawer at home, all alone
Pushing 40 in the friend zone
We talk and then you walk away, every day
Oh, you don't think twice 'bout me
And maybe you're right to doubt me, but


But if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight
Oh, I want a take two, I want to break through
I wanna know the real thing about you
So I can see you in a new light


Take a ride up to Malibu
I just wanna sit and look at you, look at you
What would it matter if your friends knew?
Who cares what other people say, anyway
Oh, we can go far from here
And make a new world together, babe


'Cause if you give me just one night
You're gonna see me in a new light
Yeah, if you give me just one night
To meet you underneath the moonlight

Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down

What makes this man, with all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away


Woah, woah
Gravity is working against me
And gravity wants to bring me down


Oh, twice as much ain't twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more that's gonna send me to my knees

How much of my mother has my mother left in me?
How much of my love will be insane to some degree?
And what about this feeling that I'm never good enough?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?


How much of my father am I destined to become?
Will I dim the lights inside me just to satisfy someone?
Will I let this woman kill me, or do away with jealous love?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?


I can feel the love I want
I can feel the love I need
But it's never gonna come the way I am
Could I change it if I wanted?
Can I rise above the flood?
Will it wash out in the water
Or is it always in the blood?


How much like my brothers do my brothers wanna be?
Does a broken home become another broken family?
Or will we be there for each other like nobody ever could?
Will it wash out in the water, or is it always in the blood?

I can feel the love I need

Fiery raining meteors

And planets keep their distance too
The moon's got a grip on the sea


And you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's your destiny


Life is full of sweet mistakes
And love's an honest one to make
Time leaves no fruit on the tree


But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, it's just meant to be




And when the pastor asks the pews
For reasons he can't marry you
I'll keep my word and my seat


But you're gonna live forever in me
I guarantee, just wait and see

But that was all before this dream that just came to me

Under the January rain
Come let me in
Take my heart by the hand
And lead me back to your room
And sing me your tune

They're draining out the wishing well
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart


Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
I just hold on


I rose in you like morning light
And sheltered you asleep at night
It breaks my heart
It takes all the love I have to say
I know we're gonna be ok
It breaks my heart
It breaks my heart


Oh honey
Oh honey
It's just a wave
It's just a wave
And I know
That when it comes
I just hold on
Until it's gone
Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here’s a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you


This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing


You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll


Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda' kept my undershirt


You’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll




Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don’t fly
Someone’s going to paint you another sky


'Cause you’re like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they’re running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall?None
It's a Friday, we finally made it
I can't believe I get to see your face
You've been working and I've been waiting
To pick you up and take you from this place


Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
Like only we can
Like only we can
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm coming up and I'm loving every minute of it


You be the DJ, I'll be the driver
You put your feet up in the getaway car
I'm flying fast like a, a wanted man
I want you, baby, like you can't understand


Oh, love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
We found a message in a bottle we were drinking
Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I hate your guts 'cause I'm loving every minute of it

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


I gotta leave ya, it's gonna hurt me
My clothes are dirty and my friends are getting worried
Down there below us, under the clouds
Baby, take my hand and pull me down, down, down, down
And I'll be dreamin' of the next time we can go
Into another serotonin overflow


Love on the weekend
Love on the weekend
I'm busted up but I'm loving every minute of it
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)


I'm looking for a little love
I'm looking for a little love, oh yeah
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)
(Love on the weekend)
We got the afternoon
You got this room for two
One thing I've left to do
Discover me, discovering you
One mile to every inch of
Your skin like porcelain
One pair of candy lips and
Your bubblegum tongue


And if you want love we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while


Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland


Something 'bout the way
Your hair falls in your face
I love the shape you take when
Crawling towards the pillowcase
You tell me where to go
And though I might leave to find it
I'll never let your head hit the bed
Without my hand behind it


You want love, we'll make it
Swim in a deep sea of blankets
I take all your big plans and break 'em
This is bound to be a while


Your body is a wonderland
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland
(I'll never speak again, again
I'll use my hands)


Damn, baby
You frustrate me
I know you're mine all mine, all mine
But you look so good it hurts sometimes


Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonder, I'll use my hands
Your body is a wonderland (I'll never speak again, again)
Your body is a wonderland (I'll use my hands)None
I'm such a bore, I'm such a bummer
There must be more behind the summer
I want someone to make some trouble
Been way too safe inside my bubble, oh
Take me out and keep me up all night
Let me live on the wilder side of the light


Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away


You carnivore, you loose cannon
Can I have some more? I can't understand it
You fast car, you foolish spender
You know you are, and I surrender
So come on over and wake me up
Put some of your tequila in my coffee cup
You know I need you, and that's for sure
You're just the kinda crazy I've been lookin' for


Carry me away
Carry me away
Carry me away
Where the sun hits my face all different
Carry me away
Carry me away
"Welcome to the real world", she said to me
Condescendingly
Take a seat
Take your life
Plot it out in black and white
Well I never lived the dreams of the prom kings
And the drama queens
I'd like to think the best of me
Is still hiding
Up my sleeve


They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side


I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above


So the good boys and girls take the so called right track
Faded white hats
Grabbing credits and
Maybe transfers
They read all the books but they can't find the answers
And all of our parents
They're getting older
I wonder if they've wished for anything better
While in their memories
Tiny tragedies


They love to tell you
Stay inside the lines
But something's better
On the other side


I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above


I am invincible
I am invincible
I am invincible
As long as I'm alive


I want to run through the halls of my high school
I want to scream at the
Top of my lungs
I just found out there's no such thing as the real world
Just a lie you've got to rise above


I just can't wait til my ten year reunion
I'm going to bust down the double doors
And when I stand on these tables before you
You will know what all this time was forNone
No it's never on the day you leave
That you wonder what you still believe in
And you can't remember why you said goodbye
You'll hear an old familiar sound and hope it's her when you turn around
But never, never on the day you leave


Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last heard her sing
She'll cut her hair and move somewhere
She don't owe you anything


No it's never on the day you leave
You can tell how it's gonna be
To watch a girl become a ghost before your eyes
You wish you'd given her one more kiss
To put away for a night like this
But never, never on the day you leave


Love grows in the time it's been
Since you last held her hand
She'll fight for you like hell
Then force herself to like some other man


No it's never on the day you leave
That you remember Christmas Eve
And all the things you miss about her crazy family
You'll know how lonely it is to see a little drug store Christmas tree
But never, never on the day you leave
No never, never on the day you leave


So maybe it'd be better off to write her
And leave a little note right there beside her
That says maybe we're not perfect
But I'll be damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
Damned if I ever leave
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love


My girl, she isn't the one
I saw coming
And sometimes I don't know which way to go
And I tried to run before
But I'm not running anymore
Because I've fought against it hard enough to know


That you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love


Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love


My boy ain't the one that I saw coming
And some have said his heart's too hard to hold
And it takes a little time
But you should see him when he shines
You never want to let that feeling go


When you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
Yeah, you love, who you love
Who you love


Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love


Oh you love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love
You love, who you love
Who you love


Oh, you can't make yourself stop dreaming
Who you're dreaming of
If it's who you love
Then it's who you love


It's who you love
Who you love
Who you love
Who you love
You're the one I loveNone
Your love is bright as ever
Even in the shadows
Baby, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Your heart is glowing
And I'm crashing into you
Baby, kiss me, kiss me
Before they turn the lights out
Before they turn the lights out
Oh, baby, love me lights out


In the darkest night I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out


Oh, we don't have forever
Baby, daylight's wasting
You better kiss me
Before our time has run out, oh
Nobody sees what we see
They're just hopelessly gazing
Oh, baby, take me, take me
Before they turn the lights out
Before time has run out
Oh, baby, love me lights out


In the darkest night I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see
I'm giviving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
Oh, you can turn my lights out


I love you like XO
You love me like XO
You kill me girl XO
You love me like XO
Is all that I see
Giving you everything
Baby, love me lights out
Baby, love me lights out
You can turn my lights out


Oh, in the darkest night I'll
I'll search through the crowd
Your face is all that I see

When sky blue gets dark enough
To see the colors of the city lights
A trail of ruby red and diamond white
Hits her like a sunrise


She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can


Tonight she's out to lose herself
And find a high on Peachtree Street
From mixed drinks to techno beats it's always
Heavy into everything


She comes and goes and comes and goes
Like no one can
She comes and goes and no one knows
She's slipping through my hands


She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away


I can't be her angel now
You know it's not my place to hold her down
And it's hard for me to take a stand
When I would take her anyway I can


She comes and she goes
Like no one can
She comes and she goes
She's slipping through my hands


She's always buzzing just like
Neon, neon
Neon, neon
Who knows how long, how long, how long
She can go before she burns away


She comes and she goes

I am driving up '85 in the
Kind of morning that lasts all afternoon
Just stuck inside the gloom
4 more exits to my apartment but
I am tempted to keep the car in drive
And leave it all behind


Because I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life


Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?


I rent a room and I fill the spaces with
Wood in places to make it feel like home
But all I feel's alone
It might be a quarter life crisis
Or just the stirring in my soul


Either way--I wonder sometimes
About the outcome
Of a still verdictless life


Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why Georgia, why?


So what, so I've got a smile on
But it's hiding the quiet superstitions in my head
Don't believe me
Don't believe me
When I say I've got it down


Everybody is just a stranger but
That's the danger in going my own way
I guess it's the price I have to pay


Still "everything happens for a reason"
Is no reason not to ask myself


Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Am I living it right?
Why? Tell me why?
Why? Why Georgia, why?
Lightning strikes
Inside my chest to keep me up at night
Dream of ways
To make you understand my pain


Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare


If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?

Verse 
Drop his name
Push it in and twist the knife again
Watch my face
As I pretend to feel no pain, pain, pain


Clouds of sulfur in the air
Bombs are falling everywhere
It's heartbreak warfare
Once you want it to begin
No one really ever wins
In heartbreak warfare


If you want more love, why don't you say so?
If you want more love, why don't you say so?


How come the only way to know how high you get me
Is to see how far I fall?
God only knows how much I'd love you if you let me
But I can't break through it all


It's a heart, heartbreak
I don't care if we don't sleep at all tonight
Let's just fix this whole thing now
I swear to God, we're going to get it right
If you lay your weapon down


Red wine and Ambien
You're talking shit again
It's heartbreak warfare
Good to know it's all a game
Disappointment has a name
It's heartbreak, heartbreak


It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
It's heartbreak warfare
Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
Dear Marie, tell me what it was I used to be?
And if you’re further up the road
Can you show me what I still can’t see?

Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Remember me, I’m the boy you used to love
When we were fifteen
Now I wonder what you think
When you see me on the magazine

From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
From time to time
I go looking for your photograph online
Some county judge in Ohio is all I ever find


Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Dear Marie, tell me do you still believe in me?
Well I’ve got my dream, but you’ve got a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but you’ve got yourself a family
Yeah I’ve got that dream, but I guess it got away from me
I hate to see you cry
Lying there in that position
There's things you need to hear
So turn off your tears
And listen


Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good


You know, it's nothing new
Bad news never had good timing
Then, the circle of your friends
Will defend the silver lining


Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
No, it won't all go the way it should
But I know the heart of life is good


Pain throws your heart to the ground
Love turns the whole thing around
Fear is a friend who's misunderstood
But I know the heart of life is good
I know it's goodNoneNone
I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing


I met me someone changing
We had some fun changing
Sometimes I wonder if she'll be the one
When I am done changing

Some of us stopped running
Some of us went home
Some of us don’t got one
So we'll build one of our own

Friends behind their fences
Looking at me strange
Wondering when I’m gonna come to my senses
But I'm still changing
And I can’t change my ways

I see the sky changing
Reminds me of my changing
Wish I could tie me a rope 'round the sun
'Cause I am not done changing


Time's been talking to me
Whispering in my ear
Saying “Follow your heart
'Til it tears you apart”
But hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing
Hearts keep changing




I am not done changing
Out on the run, changing
I may be old and I may be young
But I am not done changing
Changing

River's strong, you can't swim inside it
We could string some lights up the hill beside it
Tonight the moon's so bright you could drive with your headlights out
Because a little bit of summer's what the whole year's all about


You look fine, fine, fine
Put your feet up next to mine
We can watch that water line get higher and higher
Say, say, say
Hasn't it been some kind of day?
You and me been catching on like a wildfire


Don't get up, just to
Get another, you can
Drink from mine, we can't
Leave each other
We can dance with the dead
You can rest your head on my shoulder
If you want to get older with me
Because a little bit of summer makes a lot of history




I got a rock from the river
In my medicine bag
Magpie feather
In his medicine bag


It's really over, you made your stand
You got me crying, as was your plan
But when my loneliness is through


I'm going to find another you


You take your sweaters
You take your time
You might have your reasons
But you will never have my rhyme
I'm going to sing my way away from blue


I'm going to find another you


When I was your lover
No one else would do
If I'm forced to find another
I hope she looks like you
Yeah and she's nicer too


So go on baby
Make your little get away
My pride will keep me company
And you just gave yours all away
Now I'm going to dress myself for two
Once for me and once for someone new
I'm going to do some things you wouldn't let me do


Oh
I'm going to find another you
Take all of your wasted honor
Every little past frustration
Take all of your so-called problems
Better put 'em in quotations

And then another again

Had their eyes for your best friend


Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home

If you roll it on home


The last ten texts were with your ex
And all of 'em were sent by you
But you keep starin' at your phone like something's comin' through
Come to grips and take your chips when the cards aren't goin' your way
You've been here so long tonight's already yesterday


Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Finish out the bottle or step into the light
And roll it on home


Roll it on home
Roll it on home
Tomorrow's another chance you won't go it alone
If you roll it on home


Nobody's gonna love you right
Nobody's gonna take you in tonight
Drop a couple dollars, bum yourself a light

I'm a little birdie in a big old tree
Ain't nobody looking for me

Some nights, I throw it all away

Maybe it's a long play game
But maybe that's a good thing

Keep on riding until I see that dawn

But a look like hers can be found from time to time
Yeah, Olivia is taken
But a look like hers can be found from time to time

Close your eyes and clone yourself
Build your heart an army
To defend your innocence
While doing everything wrong

Don't be scared to walk alone
Don't be scared to like it
There's no time that you must be home
So sleep where darkness falls


Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, why should I care?"

Ooh! Ooh!


No, your fight is not with them
Yours is with your time here
Dream your dreams, but don't pretend
Make friends with what you are

Give your heart and change your mind
You're allowed to do it
Because God knows it's been done to you and
Somehow you got through it


Alive in the age of worry
Smile in the age of worry
Go out in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, why should I care?"


Rage in the age of worry
Act your age in the age of worry
And say, "Worry, get out of here"NoneNone
The summer's over
This town is closing
They're waving people out of the ocean
We have the feeling like we were floating
We never noticed where time was going

Do you remember when we first got here
The days were longer, the nights were hot here
Now, it's September; the engine's starting
You're empty-handed and heavy-hearted


But just remember on the way home
That you were never meant to feel alone
It takes a little while, but you'd be fine
Another good time coming down the line


You'll go back to love that's waiting
I'll unpack in a rented room
How's that life you swear you're hating
Grass is greener: that makes two




Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all
Life isn't short, but it sure is small
You get forever but nobody at all

It don't come often, and it don't stay long


But just remember on the way home
That you don't ever have to feel alone
Just stay on the run, get off the grid
Hide yourself out like you know that I did
And if you might find that you're running is done
A little bit of Heaven never hurt no oneNoneNone
My stupid mouth
Has got me in trouble
I said too much again
To a date over dinner yesterday
And I could see
She was offended
She said, "Well anyway..."
Just dying for a subject change

Oh, another social casualty
Score one more for me


How could I forget
Mama said, think before speaking
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one soon


We bit our lips
She looked out the window
Rolling tiny balls of napkin paper
I played a quick game of chess
With the salt and pepper shaker
And I could see clearly
An indelible line was drawn
Between what was good
What just slipped out and what went wrong

Oh, the way she feels about me has changed
Thanks for playing, try again


How could I forget
Mama said, think before speaking
No filter in my head
Oh, what's a boy to do
I guess he better find one


I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
Starting now


One more thing
Why is it my fault
So maybe I try too hard
But it's all because of this desire
Just want to be liked
Just want to be funny
Looks like the joke's on me
So call me Captain Backfire


I'm never speaking up again
It only hurts me
I'd rather be a mystery
Than she desert me
Oh I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
I'm never speaking up again
Starting now
Starting now
And these days with the world getting colder
She spends more time sleeping over
Than I planned

Tonight we're gonna order in
Drinking wine and watching CNN
It's dark, I know
But then again
It's the brightest thing I've got


When I'm covered in rain, rain
When I'm covered in rain, rain, rain, rain


From fireworks to fireplaces
Summer stole what fall replaces
And now, and now we're people watching
All the people, people watching us right back now

Standing by the missing signs
At the CVS, by the checkout line
She puts her quiet hands in mine
Cause she's the brightest thing I got


Oh, I'm covered in rain
Oh, I'm covered in rain
Oh, I'm covered in rain




And come December Lydia left
She mentioned something about it being for the best
And I can't say I disagree
And it's killing me

And now I'm standing facing west
Tracing my fingers around a silhouette
I haven't gotten used to yet
But it's the brightest thing I got


When I'm covered in rainNoneNone
I'm writing you to catch you up on places I've been
And you held this letter
Probably got excited, but there's nothing else inside it


Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words


Today, skies are painted colors of a cowboy cliche
And strange how clouds that look like mountains in the sky
Are next to mountains anyway


Didn't have a camera by my side this time
Hoping I would see the world through both my eyes
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way with words


But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s


I guess you had to be there
Guess you had to be with me


Today I finally overcame
Trying to fit the world inside a picture frame
Maybe I will tell you all about it when
I'm in the mood to lose my way
But let me say


But let me say
You should have seen that sunrise
With your own eyes
It brought me back to life
You'll be with me next time I go outside
Just no more 3x5s
I am an architect
Of days that haven't happened yet
I can't believe a month is all it's been

You know my paper heart
The one I filled with pencil marks
I think I might have gone and inked you in


Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home


So glad you didn't see
The nervous wreck I used to be
You'd never know a man could feel so small

And you never look at me
Like I'm a liability
I bet you think I've never been at all


Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home, a face to call home
A face to call home
You got a face to call home


Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
Maybe I could stay a while
I'm talking about all of the time


Little by little, inch by inch
We built a yard with a garden in the middle of it
And it ain't much, but it's a start
You got me swaying right along to the song of your heart
And a face to call home, a face to call home
You got a face to call home


Home home
Home home
Home home
Home home
I'm not alone
I wish I was
'Cause then I'd know I was down because
I couldn't find a friend around
To love me like they do right now
They do right now


I'm dizzy from the shopping mall
I searched for joy, but I bought it all
It doesn't help the hunger pains
And a thirst I'd have to drown first to ever satiate


Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
At all


When autumn comes
It doesn't ask
It just walks in where it left you last
And you never know when it starts
Until there's fog inside the glass around your summer heart


Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
At all


I can't be sure that this state of mind
Is not of my own design
I wish there was an over-the-counter test for loneliness
For loneliness like this


Something's missing
And I don't know how to fix it
Something's missing
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is
Something's different
And I don't know what it is
No I don't know what it is

How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?
What do you think it means?
How come everything I think I need
Always comes with batteries?
Here comes the cold
Break out the winter clothes
And find a love to call your own
You, enter you
Your cheeks a shade of pink
And the rest of you in powder blue


Who knows what will be
But I'll make you this guarantee, see


No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time


In the dark, on the phone
You tell me the names of your brothers
And your favorite colors
I'm learning you
And when it snows again
We'll take a walk outside
And search the sky
Like children do
I'll say to you


No way November will see our goodbye
When it comes to December it's obvious why
No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day


We should take a ride tonight around the town
And look around at all the beautiful houses
Something in the way that blue lights on a black night
Can make you feel more
Everybody, it seems to me, just wants to be
Just like you and me
Hey, hey


No one wants to be alone at Christmas time
And come January we're frozen inside
Making new resolutions a hundred times
February, won't you be my valentine?
And we'll both be safe 'til St. Patrick's Day


And if our always is all that we gave
And we someday take that away
I'll be alright if it was just until St. Patrick's Day
Did you know that you could be wrong
And swear you’re right?
Some people been known to do it
All their lives
But you find yourself alone
Just like you found yourself before
Like I found myself in pieces
On the hotel floor
Hard times help me see


I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now


Well I'm no trouble maker
And I never meant her harm
But it doesn’t mean I didn’t make it
Hard to carry on
Well it sucks to be honest (honest)
And it hurts to be real
But it's nice to make some love
That I can finally feel
Hard times let me be


I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now

I’m a good man with a good heart
Had a tough time, got a rough start
But I finally learned to let it go
Now I’m right here, and I’m right now
And I’m hoping, knowing somehow
That my shadow days are over
My shadow days are over now
Give me my badge and gun
Give me the road that I may run
Give me that peaceful, wandering free I used to know
I've waited all I can
But I'm just not a patient man
And I've been hiding here for seven months or so


Hand me down my golden hat
And grab the winter one at that
You never know how long I'll be away

Give me my badge and gun
Give me the songs that I once sung
Give me those jet-black, kick-back, lay down nights alone
This house is safe and warm
But I was made to chase the storm
Taking the whole world on with big old empty arms

Tell my friends I tried my best
That one day I just up and left
They probably saw it coming anyway
What can I say
Hey, hey

The lock is on the cellar door
I can't remember what it's for
I ain't been down those stairs in oh so long
So, so long




The copy of your key is hanging where it used to be
Good as you've always been to me
The life I need to lead
Is somewhere out there, calling over those hillsNone
People have the right to fly
And will when it gets compromised
Their hearts say "move along"
Their minds say "gotcha heart"
"Let's move it along"
Move it along


And airports see it all the time
Where someone's last goodbye
Blends in with someone's sigh
Cause someone's coming home
In hand a single rose


And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And I won't be the last
No, I won't be the last
To love her


And you can't build a house of leaves
And live like it's an evergreen
It's just a season thing
It's just this thing that seasons do


And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now
And you won't be the first
No, you won't be the first
To love me


You can find me
If you ever want again
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around the bend
I'll be around, I'll be around
And if you never stop when you wave goodbye
You just might find if you give it time, you will wave hello again
You just might wave hello again


And that's the way this wheel keeps working now
That's the way this wheel keeps working now


You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
You can't love too much, one part of it
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)
That my life's going to see (You can't love too much, one part of it)
The love I give return to me (You can't love too much, one part of it)
(You can't love too much, one part of it)
I believe (You can't love too much, one part of it)

I never liked this apple much
It always seemed too big to touch
I can't remember how I found
My way before she came around


I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name


She keeps a toothbrush at my place
As if I had the extra space
She steals my clothes to wear to work
I know her hairs are on my shirts


I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name


The day
She called up and came to me
Covered in rain
And dinnertime shadowing
And as her clothes spun, we spooned
And I knew I was through
When I said "I love you"

Friday evening, we've been drinking
2 a.m., I swear I might propose
But we close the tab
Split a cab
And call each other up when we get home
Falling asleep to the sound
Of sirens


I tell everyone
I smile just because
I've got a city love
I found it in Lydia
And I can't remember life before her name


From the battery
To the gallery
It's the kind of thing you only see
In scented, glossy magazines


And I can't remember life before her name
I've these dreams I'm walking home
Home when it used to be
And everything is as it was
Frozen in front of me

Here I stand, 6 feet small
Romanticizing years ago
It's a bitter sweet feeling
Hearing "Wrapped Around Your Finger" on the radio


And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman


Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83


Thinking about my brother, Ben
I miss him every day
He looks just like his brother, John
But on an 18 month delay

Here I stand, 6 feet small
And smiling because I'm scared as hell
Kind of like my life is like a sequel to a movie
Where the actor's names have changed, oh well


And these days
I wish I was 6 again
Oh, make me a red cape
I want to be Superman


Oh, if only my life was more like 1983
All these things would be
More like they were at the start of me
Heaven made in '83


And most my memories have escaped me
Or confused themselves with dreams
If heaven's all we want it to be
Send your prayers to me
Care of 1983

You can paint that house a rainbow of colors
Rip out the floorboards
Replace the shutters but
That's my plastic in the dirt


Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my
Whatever happened to my lunchbox?
When came the day that it got thrown away
And don't you think I should have had some say in that decision?None
If I ever get around to living
I'm going to put my things away
In the drawers and in the closets
And there I'll stay
Stay

If I ever get around to living
It's going to be just like I dreamed
I'm going to take the love I'm given
And set it free
Free

If I ever get around to living
I'll take the end of every day
Tie it up to every morning
And sail away
Away

Free
Free

Maybe it's all a dream I'm having at seventeen
I don't have tattoos
And very soon, mother will be calling me
Saying, "Come upstairs, you've got some work to do"

Trying to make it better than you got it

Searching for a sign

Don't know why Tori came by
But I could see by the look in her eyes
Tori had been driving around the town for a while
Playing with the thought of leaving

Don't know why, but Tori just smiled
And mentioned something about how you were right
Must have been hard to see through the tears she was hiding


She said, I might not be seeing him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do


Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye


Looked outside at the car in the drive
And the suitcase on the back seat inside
Sure it's so she can't look out behind at the road


She said, I might not be seeing him soon
I've got a few things I've been waiting to do


Hey, Tori came by
Tori came by tonight
Hey, Tori came by
She says to say goodbye


Don't look down, she seemed alright
You might be asking where is Tori tonight
Somewhere out on the highway, I'm sure she's fineNone
I'm so alive
I'm so enlightened
I can barely survive
A night in my mind
So I've got a plan
I'm going to find out just how boring I am
And have a good time


Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule


Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been


Is there a God?
Why is he waiting?
Don't you think of it odd
When he knows my address?
And look at the stars
Don't they remind you of just how feeble we are?
Well it used to, I guess


Cause ever since I tried
Trying not to find
Every little meaning in my life
It's been fine, I've been cool
With my new golden rule


Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
And talk is the same cheap it's been


I'm a new man
I wear a new cologne and
You wouldn't know me if your eyes were closed
I know what you'll say
This won't last longer than the rest of the day
But you're wrong this time
You're wrong


Numb is the new deep
Done with the old me
I'm over the analyzing tonight


Stop trying to figure it out
(you try to figure, you try to figure it out)
Deep will only bring you down
You know, I used to be
The back porch poet with my book of rhymes
Always open knowing all the time I'm probably
Never going to find the perfect rhyme
For "heavier things"NoneNone

Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, "Now I'm born and raised"


Born and raised
In half the time I'll be twice my age
Better learn how to turn the page
Because time is strange when you're born and raised


Born and raised
Locks of brown, streaks of gray
I was brought up in brighter days
It's good to say, "Now I'm born and raised"None
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
I went down to the crossroads, fell down on my knees
Asked the Lord for mercy
Said, help me if you please

I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride
No one seemed to know me, everybody passed me by


You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
You can run, you can run, tell my friend Willy Brown
That I'm standing at the crossroads
I believe I'm sinking downHow sad it is that time should pass
Her Majesty, the hourglass
We take the sand of bygone years
And make mud of it with all our tears

What is now compared to then
And will I ever love again?
The answer to the answer brings
The endless search for everything
Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you


I really did it to myself I guess
I saw you standing in that cocktail dress
Oh, call the press and say my life is a mess
Because I must confess to you


Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you


Fool me once and it's shame on you
Twice it's shame on me
But fool me baby for the rest of my life
And I'll be happy, happy as a broken man can be


Oh, it takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
It takes a fool to love you
Oh, and I'm just the fool for you


Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
Oh, now I'm just the fool for you
I think I'm going to stay home
Have myself a home life
Sitting in the slow-mo
And listening to the daylight
I am not a nomad
I am not a rocket man
I was born a house cat
By the slight of my mother's hand
I think I'm going to stay home


I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I used to be in my M-Z now
You'll never find me 'cause my name isn't there


Home life
Been holding out for a home life
My whole life


I want to see the end game
I want to learn her last name
Finish on a Friday
And sit in traffic on the highway
See, I refuse to believe
That my life's going to be
Just some string of incompletes
Never to lead me to anything remotely close to a home life


Been holding out for a home life
My whole life


I can tell you this much
II will marry just once
And if it doesn't work out
Give her half of my stuff
It's fine with me
We said eternity
And I will go to my grave
With the life that I gave
Not just some melody line
On a radio wave
It dissipates
And soon evaporates
But home life doesn't change (home life doesn't change)


I want to live in the center of a circle
I want to live on the side of a square
I'd love to walk to where we both can talk, but
I've got to leave you cause my ride is here


In my home life
You take the home life
You keep the home life
I'll come back for the home life
I promise
Home life I promise
Life
Home life
Home lifeNoneOnce upon most every morning
I woke up to her flying there
Hummingbird was making blows of
Blowing rings of purple in the air

All the while
I was trying to keep her there
Not man enough to need
But man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird

That's all I heard
That's my hummingbird

Just because I said I didn't want her
Doesn't mean I want her to go
In fact, I quite depended on her
But that I didn't want her to know
Now that's she's gone I know
All the while
I was trying to keep her there, ya

Not man enough to need
But man enough to always care
Hummingbird
Hummingbird
That song i heard, I heard
That's my Hummingbird
Hummingbird
Hummingbird

Is it too late
Too late, hummingbird?
I don't need no doctor
Because I know what's ailing me
I don't need no doctor
Because I know what's ailing me
I've been too long away from my baby, yeah
I'm coming down with a misery


I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled
(I don't need no doctor)
(I don't need no doctor)


No, no, no, I don't need no doctor
For my prescription to be filled, yeah
Only my baby's arms could ever
Could ever take away this chill

Now the doctor say I need rest
For I need is her tenderness
He put me on the critical list
When all I need is her sweet kiss
He gave me a medicated lotion
But it didn't soothe my emotion, yeah
All I need is my baby, please!
Won't you please just come on home?
Come on homeNoneNoneNone
Go easy on me for the night has been long
I’m not quite as strong as you see me
I came here alone and I’ll leave on my own
The next stop is home so go easy on me
Oh, I don’t need your truth
Or a good talking-to from your mountain
No, I don’t know your name and I won’t take the blame
Don’t know what you need, so go easy on me
Go easy on me, for I mean you no harm
It’s possible charm is in order
But you make it so hard when you throw up your guard
I’m not here to spar so go easy on me
Oh, the clanging of swords
And the war of the words doesn’t move me
See, my heart barely works and it’s covered in dirt
It still kind of hurts, so go easy on me
Oh, I see in your eyes
You don’t realize what you’re doing
So, here’s some advice, never hurts to be nice
If you’re not going to be, then go easy on me
Go easy on me, go easy on me
Hey babe
What do you expect me to say?
I could tell you that I'm doing great
But darling, I'm just not okay
Hey babe
Why did we throw it away?
Without you I just ain't the same
And darling, I'm just not okay
Hey babe
I've been putting on my bravest face
Just looking for ways to replace you
And darling, I'm just not okay
Hey babe
It isn't like me to complain
But you don't look at me the same
And darling, I'm just not okay
Hey babe
What do you expect me to say?
I could tell you that I'm doing great
But darling, I'm just not okayNone
Well, I sleep all day
And drink all night
Just give me one good reason
And I'll turn out my light
Now I'm terrified
Now I'm terrified
And I've heard all the people
Calling my name
But they'll never see just
How I've changed
Now I'm terrified
Now I'm terrified
But I don't wanna be your boy, I wanna be your man
But something's got me wrong inside
And I'm looking for the answer I don't understand
And darling, I am terrified
I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this
You know, I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this
Well, it's hard to explain
How it got this way
And people only want to know why
But I wish I had an answer that would make it okay
But the truth is I'm just terrified
And I don't need to remember
But I wanna forget
'Cause there's a hole in my head where
I hide my regret
Now I'm terrified
Now I'm terrified
But I don't wanna be your boy, I wanna be your man
But something's got me wrong inside
And I'm looking for the answer I don't understand
Darling, I am terrified
I'm terrified
That maybe I wasn't cut out for this
You know, I'm terrified
That maybe I wasn't cut out for this
You now, you could come and save me
But you'd have to take a risk
'Cause I'm terrified that maybe
I wasn't cut out for this
I wasn't cut out for this
Fever rising in the setting sun
Cocaine in your eyes and bullets in your gun
'N' blood in your nails is scratching for the face
With a noose 'round your neck and a needle in your vein
Ooh, and you say...
How did I get here and can I get back
I thought I was having fun, but no
I was just looking for the one
Always - looking for the one
Well, you don't thank fuck that you got a home
Now your friends have left you and you're on your own
And the woman in your life wasn't quite enough
So, you let her go and leave you and it broke your heart
Well, your mind is empty and your heart is cold
And your last routines are getting old
Now, people seeing through your web of lies
And they're fucking the demons that war inside
Careful what you wish for from the steady life
If you want too much you might lose your mind
If you only want the woman you saw on TV
Then your eyes are open but you just can't see


Ooh, and you say...
How did you get here and will you get back
I thought we were having fun, but no
We were just looking for the one
Always - looking for the one


How did I get here and can I get back
I thought I was having fun, but no
I was just looking for the one
Always - looking for youNoneNone
Tryna find a reason for love
When I would cross the Styx in a minute or two
Looking for my answers from above
The only home I knew was for me and you
All the things I'm doing to myself
Digging holes in my brain, trying to hide away
You know when it gets bad for your health
Things have gotta change 'cause they're not the same


But it's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold, broke mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
Now I don't even get to be alone


Talking ain't as easy when you're down
I know you know I'm tryna find the words to say
You told me you would always be around
But now you're gone I know that we were not okay
I'm so afraid of going home
So don't you go leave me on my own
Baby, why the hell you acting so cold?
I guess I'll never know, guess I'll never know


'Cause it's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold, broke mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold, broke mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
My cold, broke mind
It's all in my mind, all in my mind
Now I don't even get to be alone


Tryna find a reason for love
When I would cross the Styx in a minute or two
Looking for my answers from above
The only home I knew was for me and for you
Tryna find a reason for love
When I would cross the Styx in a minute or two
Looking for my answers from above
The only home I knew was for me and for you
Down in the basement, locked in my head
Are all of the words that I wish you had said
You're so impatient, asleep on my bed
Dreaming we'd left it and made love instead
But there's still some problems, that I need to cure
So turn on the light babe, let's find where it hurts
'Cause I love to love you, but I'm still unsure
And each time we fight babe, we're only making it worse

And you know that I know, that you know
That I gave you more than I should
I guess that means love
Ain't always so good


The floorboards are creaking, the Sun's going down
You're watching me speaking, but won't make a sound
I'm fighting this feeling that we're falling through
The less that you offer the more that I lose
So just throw me a bone babe, and shoulder my pain
Why do we suffer to hide from our shame?
When it's not like we'll live like this ever again
So come on now, darling, and try to just treat me the same


'Cause I know, that you know, that I know
That I gave you more than I should
I guess that means love
Ain't always so good
Well, she wore you like silk
Bandaged all around
The scars of your love
Became your hollow crown
And she held you through the night
And kissed you through the cold
Blinded by your light
Just waiting to grow old


She said, love, I'd give you everything
I'd give you everything that you need
Oh, love, well I'd do anything
And I'd do anything to be seen


So when you packed all of your bags
And left without a word
Well, the voices in her head
Were begging to be heard
So she wept all through the night
And slept all through the day
'Cause her lonely, lonely heart
Was caught in every trap you laid


And she said, love, I'd give you everything
I'd give you everything that you need
Oh, love, well I'd do anything
Yes, I'd do anything to be seen


Why did we break down?
Why did we break down?
Was it just
'Cause we weren't ready?
Why did we break down?
Why did we break down?
Was I vulnerable, or too unsteady?

And why did we break down?
And why did we break down?
Was it just
'Cause we weren't ready?
And why did we break down?
And why did we break down?
Was I too vulnerable, or too unsteady?


Oh, love, I gave you everything
I gave you everything that you need
Oh, love, well I'd do anything
Yes, I'd do anything
To be free
To be free
To be free
I'm getting in with the wrong crowd
I'm talking too loud
I think I'm starting to get people down
And when I talk about it too much
I think they lose touch
And then I bury my head in the ground

Oh baby how'd you let me get here
You said you'd stay here
But it feels like you're never around
And every time I try to stand up
I put my hands up

Oh have you looked at me lately?


Oh oh oh baby oh oh oh
Don't forget me, forget me
This is not how we were meant to be
I'm running on empty


I bought two tickets for the rodeo
Just so you know
I think I'm tryna get back in your head
For all the times you said you knew me
You looked right through me
While another man lies in my bed

Oh baby look at how you made me
I'm going crazy
Is this really how you want it to be
And every time I try to stand up
I put my hands up

Oh have you looked at me lately?


Oh oh oh baby oh oh oh
Don't forget me, forget me
This is not how we were meant to be
I'm running on empty


Oh oh oh baby oh oh oh
Don't forget me, forget me
This is not how we were meant to be
I'm running
Running into one another, outside a cafe in Paris
You say you're living with your brother, because he lets you stay rent free
But you can't speak the local language and so no matter how you try
You say you don't know how you'll manage, since the death of you and I


Running into one another, feelings come flooding back again
You say you've been with many others, but that it never tastes the same
Now you don't know how to feel wiping tears from your eyes
Nothing ever felt so real, since the death of you and I


Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I


Running into one another, you say you want to run and hide
'Cause you still haven't recovered from the day that our love died
So am I wasting all my time tryna make it up to you
Well if you said that you were mine there's not a thing that I won't do


Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I


Said that my sins couldn't be forgiven
Praying at the altar but the gods don't listen
Life without your love ain't a life worth living
Try to go alone but there's something missing
I got nothing left since the death of you and I

Drunk most nights with no direction
Sobriety bites like your last rejection
It's been seven long days since the resurrection
Remember when your body was my confection
I got nothing left since the death of you and I


Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and I
Since the death of you and INoneI've never been so in and out of touch
I've never given so little promised so much
I've never used a woman like you, before
You've never been so sure and so afraid
You've never been so broken and so brave
I'll never lose a woman like you, again

Wondering when
Carry me home
Keep my love
When you come
When you go

I don't want to do this anymore
We've been down this lonely road once before
We've seen it all
We know the flaws
I don't want to sing another song
About the ways I got everything wrong
To list it all, just takes too long

Wondering when
Carry me home
Keep my love
When you come
When you go

Wondering when
Carry me home
Keep my love
When you come
When you go

Keep my love
When you come
When you goNone
Show me love
Why am I standing here?
Oh, would you show me love
Before you disappear?
'Cause I was never enough
To make a change
But if you call this love
Then it's a violent game


You tear me up, I like it
Bury my soul
Too long I've tried to fight it
I won't let you go


Lay your body down by mine
Your love can be my crime
My killer, be my guide
Lay your sickness down by mine, oh
Smoke and drink my wine
You're poison, so am I


Show me love
Show me love
So tell me why
You've painted pictures in my mind?
Now you're wasting time
Too bored to draw the line


You tear me up, I like it
Bury my soul
Too long I've tried to fight it
I won't let you go


Lay your body down by mine
Your love can be my crime
My killer, be my guide
Lay your sickness down by mine, oh
Smoke and drink my wine
You're poison, so am I

Lay your body down by mine
Your love can be my crime

Smoke and drink my wine
(Show me love)
You're poison, so am INoneNoneNone
Shadows converging in my mind
All of the love I've left behind
Drifting into cloudy skies
Get in lost behind your eyes

But now my dreams they come alive
With your kisses, I remember
All those lonely, lonely nights
We got caught out in a rain


Was our love a work of art
Before the painting fell apart
What was that I heard you say
It's just the darkness of the day

And were we better at the start
Before I offered you my heart
Before the demons came to play
Within the darkness of the day

And how can I be so afraid
The broken promises I made
Now I watch your memory fade
Into the darkness of the day


Sinking into isolation
Searching for a motivation
Cuz love is not an occupation
Just a shelter from the rain

Staring out my bedroom window
Thinking baby are you there
Staring out your bedroom window
Baby do you even care


Was our love a work of art
Before the painting fell apart
What was that I long to say
It's just the darkness of the day

And were we better at the start
Before I offered you my heart
Before the demons came to play
Within the darkness of the day

And how can I be so afraid
The broken promises I made
Now I watch your memory fade
Into the darkness of the day

And how can I be so afraid
Broken promises we made
Now I watch our memory fade
Into the darkness of the day

It's just the darkness of the day
Only the darkness of the day
Only the darkness of the day
How loud would I have to scream
To make a sound, to let you know?
And how tenderly would I have to whisper
That it's ok, that we can go?
But how cold the touch of your tongue
Your weighted words make no sound


But how violent must my loneliness become
To burn my clothes, bury my crown?
'Cause would it be enough for you to love me
And would I be enough for you?


How reckless is the heart that bleeds for love
That knows the warmth, that knows the taste?
And how blessed is the diamond in the rough
Who would offer her embrace?
And how foolishly the lonely mind can wander
And blinding lights falling down
And I'm sorry that I didn't tell you sooner
So burn my clothes, and burn my crown


'Cause would it be enough for you to love me?
Oh no, it wouldn't
I'd never be enough for youNoneLooking out upon the bleak horizon
And I'm not sure what it is that I see
But I've got all the answers
That you can't seem to process in me

And heaven knows I'm lonely now with you babe
And heaven knows I'm blinder than before
But heaven knows I'm worth it
And we both know heaven wants us at it's doors

But I can't seem to form the words to get you back
And if I could I'd say them all in rhyme
'Cause I can't bear to forget you
And I'm sure you've forgotten me but that's fine

And we don't have all the time left to make a move
We're older now than we were back then
I'm sorry for how I've acted
I'm so sorry for how I acted again

But oh take me with you when you go away from home
'Cause last time you left me alone on my own
Oh take me with you when you go away from home
'Cause last time you left me alone on my own

So looking out upon the bleak horizon
And I'm not sure what it is that I see
But I've got all the answers
That you can't seem to process in meNoneNone

You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everything's in order in your black hole
Nothing seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?


'Cause, oh, the boy's a slag, the best you've ever had
The best you've ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Not as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up
1, 2, 3, 4


And now you're flicking through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when you were told you're gonna get it
I'm guessing that you'd rather just forget it
And clinging to not being sentimental
You said you weren't going but you went still
You like your gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?


'Cause, oh, the boy's a slag, the best you've ever had
The best you've ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Not as daft as they seem, not as daft as they seem
My love, when you dream them up
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go?
Oh, Flo


Fallin' about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You just sounding it out
You're not coming back again


You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis

Don't let your light shine on me no more
When I am lost and you are found
Don't take the blame from me no more
Your sympathy means nothing to me know

Look how you break me

She’s underwater again
Somebody’s daughter, a friend
In the night in the dark in the cold
As she walks far away


Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
I don’t mind
Hope is a distance unreached
Ink on her skin incomplete
And the faint sound of friends
As she neared to the end she had peace

Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free

I don’t mind
I don’t mind

Where does a star go from here?
Lost in the grip

Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free


I don’t mind
I don’t mind
I don’t mind
I don’t mind
I write in cursive lines
And I need the help
I miss the shelter of knowing
Nothing else


And I will never be
I will never be myself
I will never be
I will never be too well


I'd walk the corners
Of my empty mind
But I'm full of darkness
With the loneliest of light


And I will never be
I will never be myself
I will never be
I will never be too well


And we'll be fine, there is an end
It hurts to fall back again
And we'll be fine, I promise, oh
It hurts to fall back so low
And we'll be fine, there is an end
It hurts to fall back again
And we'll be fine, I promise, oh
It hurts to fall back so low, back so low


We will always be
We always be alright
We will always be
We will always beNone
When the sun rises silver
If it rises at all
Meet me there across the water
And we'll start an endless storm


Rain falls in love
We fall in love


Together we walk the English winter
So caught up in one another
Who cares if we're under thunder showers
The rain is ours and we are lovers of
Heavy weather


Come out lightning tries to strike us
We might be frightened but we won't run
We be so happy if we were fearless
And in the darkness we will become


Rain falls in love
We fall in love


Together we walk the English winter
So caught up in one another
Who cares if we're under thunder showers
The rain us ours and we are lovers of
Heavy weather


Heavy weather, heavy weather
Heavy weather, heavy weather
Heavy weather, heavy weather
Heavy weather, heavy weather


Together we walk the English winter
So caught up in one another
Who cares if we're under thunder showers
The rain us ours and we are lovers of
Together we walk the English winter
So caught up in one another
Who cares if we're under thunder showers
The rain us ours and we are lovers of
Heavy weather, heavy weather
Breaking my back in the heart of this land
Feet above water and softened in sand
I could have wanted any part of this


But I find the heat is too harsh on the skin
Drowning in light need the cold to sink into my soul
My soul


Ignore signs of change, no more
I come back again, I am flawed


Swallow me whole with the moon on my back
One side is pink and the other is black
I'm good at hiding in the dead and grey


But time after time I've been people I'm not
Places we go to, are all that we've got
So why don't we go? So why don't we go?
I'll never know


Ignore signs of change, no more
I come back again, I am flawed
I've never been too bold
Keeping in the quiet and shade
I could run away with all my time
Wouldn't it feel the same?


Oh this is lonely territory
I've got miles and miles ahead
How I wish that I was lionhearted
And if you talk to me and I don't reply
I am way over here on the other side


I'm gonna find my head
Even if it takes all night
Even though I try my hardest
How I try with all my might


Oh I'll be waiting on this hillside
I see miles and miles ahead
How I wish that I was lionhearted
And if you talk to me and I don't reply
I am way over here on the other side


What would life be like
With a lion heart inside
Instead of mine
Give me another
What would life be like
With a lion heart inside
Instead of mine
Give me another
What would life be like (What would life be like )
With a lion heart inside (With a lion heart inside)
Instead of mine (Instead of mine)

It doesn't really matter if I'm happy or sad
It's bigger than the rest of us he'll promise you that, I'm glad, I'm glad
He's picking up the drinks and then he's knocking them back
I've never seen someone who wears a sad little mask like that, like that


The only guy that has got you in the palm of his hand
Is busy today with someone else's plans
She chooses life and then she chooses her man


It doesn't really matter if I'm happy or sad
In any case, I look at him, my life ain't half as bad, as bad

He chooses life and then she chooses a man
He's picking it up but she don't give a damn


Hold me, it's a crisis that we're pulling towards
Cartoon people fighting an American war

Feel the feet I drag along
Please give me back my strength for this sorrow
And I'll try again tomorrow
But, I'm weighted by this stone
It hangs at the back of my throat

We don't have grace, we are foolish inside
I'm not in my place, and I'd like to know why most of all
But it's so hard to find out
Your minds are far better than mine
And I struggle with it all the time

Take my coat and have it for your own
Out there's a world that I've not been shown
It's on the outside, but it's a river too wide
For I'm weighted by this stone
It hangs at the back of my throat
And it hurts me so
And it hurts me soNoneNone
In the early hours I left to find a way
Though the world is moving on, I'm still the same
Fear will kill my mind at last, the thought
The strain, no more hiding under health
But I find it hard to pray


And I want you to hurt my heart like you always could
And I bet it would feel better than this darkness
For I can do no good
For I can do no good


Winter stole the light again, the pools of green
Frightened by the sun so white, a sight I'd never seen
Since I'm blue forever more, I find it hard to cope
And there's someone out to get me
There's someone out to get me


But I want you to hurt my heart like you always could
And I bet it would feel better than this darkness
For I can do no good
For I can do no good
Soft are your hands on the weight of the world
Making your mark with your delicate touch
Pulling me in, pulling me in
Pulling me in with your natural charm


It's not air that you're breathing
It's the truth you inhale
Stretching out, testing reaches like that endless open rail
It's not air that you're breathing
It's the truth you inhale


You broke
You broke all there was to be broken
You've fallen down
But I'll be, I'll be watching over all you see


Mind is so clouded and covered in smoke
What isn't mine is starting to choke
You're just a flag, you'll be flying too close
Keep holding on but you're wanting to be wild


And it's true 'bout what they say
When you're young and unaware
But the mind can still go forward of what lies elsewhere
And it's true 'bout what they say
When you're young and unaware


You broke
You broke all there was to be broken
You've fallen down
But I'll be, I'll be watching over all you see

But I'll be, I'll be watching over all you seeRibbon of the river by my side
I walk the shores and watch it unwind
The railway tracks will leave a glimpse of the light
From the train, trailing sparks of gold behind

And as soon as you're seen it it's gone
As soon as you've seen it it's gone

Secrets of the city
Make an aching in my heart
And the mysteries that tease me so
I long to belong but I always have to go

People stare and wonder why I stray
They don't understand that wandering's my way
I'll never stop, though time is slipping away
The elusive light, shining strange on my face

As soon as you've seen it it's gone
As soon as you've seen it it's gone

Secrets of the city
Make an aching in my heart
And the mysteries that tease me so
I long to belong but I always have to go

Home ties me up
With discontent
Since the day I first went
Yearning to be back again
How will I return and when

Secrets of the city
Make an aching in my heart
And the mysteries that tease me so
I long to belong but I always have to goWe can fight our desires
But when we start making fires
We get ever so hot
Whether we like it or not

They say we can love who we trust
But what is love without lust
Two hearts with accurate devotions
What are feelings without emotions

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
Now let go of my hand

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
Now let go of my hand

I hang my hopes out on the line
Will they be ready for you in time
If you leave them out too long
Will they be withered by the sun
Full stops and exclamation marks
My words stumble before I start

How far can you send emotion?
Can this bridge cross the ocean?

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
Now let go of my hand

People open windows
They leave their houses
Just for a short while
They walk by the grass
And they sit on the grass
They look at the sky
It's going to be a fine night tonight
It's going to be a fine day tomorrow

Sitting in this field
I remember how we were going to sit in this field
But, never quite did
Rain or appointments or something

Oh my lonely heart, she could hang around for days
Will never leave the house, something more than just a phase
She'd eat occasionally, just like she would when she’s alone
She'll play the game for free until she dies, until she dies


She howls she dances
She howls as she does
She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
Just like a wolf


And as she reads aloud, ankles hanging off the bed
She'll read to nobody, or was it something that she said?
She is like the trees, the sun that creeps through my window
She knows her body, the kind that turns you into gold


She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
She howls as she dances
She howls as she does
Just like a wolf


And I’m jealous of her feet
The way she runs from nobody
The way she walks right through the sea
And how she'll make you weep

Took the breath from my open mouth
Never known how it broke me down
I went in circles somewhere else
Shook the best when your love was home
Storing up on your summer glow
You went in search of someone else


And I hear your ship is comin' in
Your tears a sea for me to swim
And I hear a storm is comin' in
My dear, is it all we've ever been?


Caught the air in your woven mouth
Leave it all, I'll be hearing how you went
In search of someone else
They taught the hand that taut the bride
Both our eyes locked to the tide
We went in circles somewhere else


And I hear your ship is comin' in
Your tears a sea for me to swim
And I hear a storm is comin' in

Take the weather from your heart
And the weight from on your toes
And there's nothing to your side
For you to recognise
It tarnished long ago


The lake will overflow
Flood all I've ever known
Break walls and sever bones
Now I'll hold it in my heart
Just for you to fall apart
Stunt all we'd ever grown


Burn the bed and the dreams I've never met
Those wishes were never for granted
So burn the bed I'll face the wind and fill my head
Those wishes were never for granted


You'll drop for a new charm
Put the thunder in my arms
Hope for them to close
Leave nothing to my side
Take all I recognise
And varnish your old blows


Burn the bed and the dreams I've never met
Those wishes were never for granted
So burn the bed I'll face the wind and fill my head
Those wishes were never for granted
Oh, those wishes were never for granted
Be it at your best
It's still our nest
Unknown a better place
Narrow your breath
From every guess
I've drawn my birthplace


Oh, I don't need a friend
I won't let it in again


Be at my best
And I fall, obsessed in all its memory
And dove out to our death, to be undressed
A love, in birth and reverie


I don't want a friend
I won't let it in again
I don't need a friend
I won't let it in again


Here, at my best
It's all at rest
And I found a better placeI’m breathing black and white, let it fool
Caught by your linen eyes, let them fool

But I don’t know where we went,
my dear don’t unfold me and call it all pretend,
be here and be holy
I don’t know where we went
my dear don’t unfold me
I’m coloured in again, in you

Green where my red love lies, was it all?
Don’t wear your winning prize, let it fool

I don’t know where we went

oh, what a way to be living with all of your pain
oh, what a way to be locking your heaven away

Low, a part of me now
A palm to my mouth

Snow, brother, I'll bet it all gold
Shudder with blood in my nose
I had it, almost
Don't go, you're half of me now
But I'm hardly stood proud
I said it, almost
Oh, I've been low, but damn it, I bet it don't show
It was heaven a moment ago
Oh, I had it, almost
We had it, almost
Oh, I can't seem to let myself leave you
But I can't breathe anymore
Oh, I can't seem to not need to need you
And I can't breathe anymore
Hollow to the touch
Make mischief at your best

Fake belief and rest
With frozen feet I'll move

I make sparks
In awesome ways
The dripping tap
Consuming my head
Yeah, you took off
With little conflict in your way
And I'm not good at winning fights anymore
I’m just a needle in the hay
I emptied out
The contents of my case and stayed a while
The heavy load I bore I wait a while
And bare the swelling of my curse
But I gave ground
A bit of shove so you would see
I won't be biting at my tongue anymore
I could be catching up on sleep
I made a b-line up to the gate
Met with your eyes and it was appalling
We took a rest sitting on our feet
These are the memories I keep
We made the law but it shook the ground
Keeping it working was everything
That would keep it from all going down
And you're sat up
And I lie downNoneNoneNone

With all my shame, I will watch you wash away

Fore go this ritual of silence
My thoughts collapse me
Under go your habitual ways of violence
I'm strung up today
The night falls earlier these days
But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze
Drifting away from me
My love will be waiting near so hungry
Throw away my necessities
And you will be in my past
The nights fall easier your way
But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze
Oh you're paramount and I'm just shallow now in your tides
Oh you're paramount, so leave me narrow and surmount my mind
And so we drift

Become individual
My vibrance is gone with the wind
We're numb, we have heard it all before
Our silence escapes your thoughts
And the night falls earlier these days
But the stars aren't as bright as they were in our old summer haze
Oh you're paramount and I'm just shallow now in your tides
Oh you're paramount, so leave me narrow and surmount my mind
Oh you're paramount and I'm just shallow now in your tides
Oh you're paramount, so leave me narrow and surmount my mind
And so we drift
My eyes, heavy underwater
Resting in the rain
I let go of all the ones I knew
Thoughts of shame

My ties broke in my hands
Colors bleeding out
I let go of all that I once knew
Causing pain

So I flay my love if I had enough
It's not okay to go and say you don't know
So I flay my love if I had enough
It's not okay to go and leave me alone

Her eyes heavy in December
Dusk falls in vain
She threw away all that we once drew
Now I'm lying out of frame

So I flay my love if I had enough
It's not okay to go and say you don't know

Down from the stars you then started to fly
And from there you could see as you fell through the miles
The place where you lived through the telephone lines
Theres the yard and the trees, the roses you like
When you woke up and you knew you'd be fine
If it happened to be the place where it ends
At least you would know how to land on a
Means to a mend

Fresh off my flight my ears were still ringin
You said come by for some dancin and singin
And stay for the day or til it feels right
You could forget LA for a couple a nights
And remember what brought you back to the place
Anytime you think you need us that way
If it happens to be the place where it ends
At least you would know how to land on a
Means to a mend

My last night in Pasadena
I spent just dying to see ya

Maybe it’s all worth it even if it isn’t perfect
Nothing really ever goes to plan
I just need a person who will hear just how I’m hurting
When something not so pleasant hits the fan

My last night in Pasadena
I spent just dying to see ya

Every time you eat alone you say you’re thinking of me
Cause I used to say, “that’s what I like”
I guess I am also prone to feeling kinda lonely
When I’m by myself and taking bites

My last night in Pasadena
I spent just dying to see ya

Oh, ohh
I have no itinerary
I’m without a guide
I don’t have a story ready I can hide behind

I didn’t practice every line I thought I’d say
It wouldn’t come out right if I did anyway


I don’t have a plan
I just planned on you


I know it’s been quite a while since
I’ve been on your mind
But do you have room in yours
Like you have room in mine?

I know my silence was the hardest song to hear
I know my ghost ride of a heart was hard to steer


I don’t have a plan
I just planned on you


If you don’t see me as part of your solution
And the storm I bring still clouds you with confusion
I will plan to go back to plans unknown

But if you make a plan to love and let me in
My only promise is to not let go again
I won’t need a plan I’ll just plan on you
I'll just plan on youBrook Revisited

Have you ever seen someone with dreamcatchers for teeth
Islands in their eyes and fire in their speech
Hair grown like the willow tree and water runnin' in their name
And so how could you blame

A river born is water that was meant to move
How could I catch water that ran through my youth
Everyday I wonder what you turned into and what you became

Are you the very same
Are you the very same

Brook who told me you're the one I needed
I was in the kitchen while my heart was bleedin'
Oh, I never knew if it was okay to feel it
Oh, I suppose I should know

The past is void, and all the future’s too
And neither will make sense just as they never do
Julie called me up and when she asked me if I heard the news

I knew that it was true
I knew that it was true

When Brook told me Drew’s the one you're leavin'
I was in the kitchen while my heart was bleedin'
Oh, I never knew if it was okay to feel it
Oh, I suppose, I should know

The loudest prayers are silent in the way they move
The greatest secrets ever found are in my youth

We’re all just a couple kids with dreamcatchers for teeth
Islands in our eyes and fire in our speech
Tryin' to find some freedom from the troubled streams of form

That's why I feel it all
That's why I feel it all

When I told Brook you're the one I needed
I was in the kitchen while my heart was bleedin'
Oh I never knew if it was okay to feel it
Oh, I should know, I should know
You leave, you turn me to see my
Body’s just a monument the spirit bleeds in
Drawn in like the river, drawn in like the brook, and
Oh, I should know, I should know

You’re never comin' back
You're never comin' back
You're never comin' back
You're never comin' backNoneNoneNoneNoneUp the backroads, through the Glens
Passed the rapper's dog who’s chained up to the fence
In the mountainside the pavement's
Three hours ahead from where you left

All my love goes to you there
It goes to you there

Arizona with the band
Drivin through the desert makes my left arm tan
And the right one strums and pales in comparison
From when I left
Can we do one more?
Not here yet
You were runnin late I thought you'd miss the set
Then your entrance came and I smiled a cave
I couldn’t hold it in until you left

All my love goes to you there
It goes to you there
All my love goes to you there
It goes to you

Wrote a postcard to my mom
Happy Mothers Day from your son in Tuscon
And I swear I could hear her laugh
Three hours ahead from where I left

All my love goes to you there
It goes to you there
All my love goes to you there
It goes to you thereNoneNoneWhen the tree fell on your car
And made your windshield fall apart
You called me and i always wondered why
Cuz i don’t have the auto parts
And you have your insurance card
Maybe i remind you of the time
You came out of nowhere
And you shattered me to pieces
And left me on my own to clean the shards
You gave me your reasons
And you asked me how i’m feeling
I said don’t you worry now it’s just my heart
It’s just my heart
It’s just my heart

I gave you a point and shoot
Now someone else’s point of view
Is looking through the lens to get the shot
And maybe if they focus
They will get the added bonus
Of seeing things more clear than what i got
Cuz you came out of nowhere
And you shattered me to pieces
And left me on my own to clean the shards
You gave me your reasons
And you asked me how i’m feeling
I said don’t you worry now it’s just my heart
It’s just my heart
It’s just my heart
It’s just my heart
It’s just my heart
It’s just my heart

It’s your natural tendency
To hit me up when you’re in need
But i think i might need it all to stop
Cuz i have rolled up every sleeve
And i’ve been on my hands and knees
And everything is healed except one spot
It’s just my heart
It’s just my heartNoneNoneNoneI guess i thought it was a little different then it really is between us
Between us there’s a space i thought we’d never have
Between us
I guess i’ll make some friends
Sit alone at zebulon again
And meet them
I’ll meet them
If i find the strength to go and talk
I’ll meet them
But they don’t stand a chance
At having something like i thought we did
Between us
Between us
You’re the only friend i ever had
Worth keepin
And if i see someone we both know
And they ask me what’s up between us
I’ll keep it
Like the only way i ever would
Between us
Between usNoneI wasn’t perfect when I was born
The doctor didn’t tell my parents “Well, you nailed it!”
When they cut my umbilical cord
They said what should we do, is there anything more?
The doctor told them he’s no different than the babies before
He’s gotta kill it like he’s careless
Rock it regardless

I must admit that I have never fit
I’m just a generic kid who don’t know what to lift
When I enter the doors of a gym
And while the big boys stare down mirrors at their beefy limbs
I’m playing all their woman’s favorites at the foot of their beds
Well they might kill me if I’m careless
Rock me regardless
Well if they might kill me if i’m careless
Oh you rock me regardless

I can not fake in the morning and nights not much better
I’m feelin strange, as you sit there in only a sweater
Well I would die for your love oh i would
But you just kill me like you’re careless
You rock me regardless
Oh well we could kill it like we’re careless
Rock it regardlessGlory in the summer
With a mouth of chlorine water
I hide nothing from ya
As my eyes are turning red

Siren in its slumber
World away from all my blunders
Love is pooling under
With my feet over the edge

With my feet over the edge
With my feet over the edge

As we're playing colors
I forget to run the numbers
Step away from trouble
We're just doing what we can

With you, I'm no other
Than a toothy grin and dreamlike colors
Underneath a blanket fort
Where I can feel my best

You're where I can feel my best
You're where I can feel my best

(Ah ah)

Floating on my stomach
Hold my breath and blow some bubbles
Letting myself let go
I'm cross-legged at the end

Champagne supernova
I'd prefer a diet soda
Greeted with a towel
And someone to call a friend

You're someone to call a friend
You're someone to call a friend
You're someone to call a friend
You're someone to call a friend

You're someone to call a friend
You're someone to call a friend
You're someone to call a friend
You're someone to call a friendNoneNoneWatched the game on the tv
Saw your parents leaving
Saw somebody different in your seat
And if we were speakin
I might have no reason
Looking for you all day on a screen

And now it hits me like it never hit before
And now it hits me like it never hit before

Maybe its all the runnin that is comin
Back to me and im to blame
I left for nothin
Is there something i could run with
That would make u wanna stay
Or is there nothin

I have season tickets to seasonal sickness
Sadness always saves a seat for me
Maybe your forgiveness finally found its limit
Watchin from the nosebleeds ain't so sweet

And now it hits me like it never hit before
And now it hits me like it never hit before

Maybe its all the runnin that is comin

Needles will never fright me
I guess its just something in my blood
And though I love the driving
Sometimes the road is frightening
I guess its just part of growing up

Calm me down, face me forward
Calm me down, face me forward
Calm me down

Sometimes I push love away
Sometimes I beg for it to stay
Tryna find the best within myself
With so many things to say
Sometimes the right thing gets away
And it comes out way worse than it was felt

Calm me down, face me forward
Calm me down, face me forward
Calm me down, face me forward
Calm me down, face me forwardNone
Her eyes and words are so icy
Oh, but she burns
Like rum on the fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire


It looks ugly, but it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me


The way she tells me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine


Calls of guilty thrown at me, all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother


But I want it, it's a crime
That she's not around most of the time


The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine


Her fight and fury is fiery
Oh, but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing


And it's worth it, it's divine
I have this some of the time


The way she shows me I'm hers and she is mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?

Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me


No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No "Who cares?", no vacant stare
No time for me


Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door


Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?

Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin


To the strand, a picnic planned
For you and me
A rope in hand for your other man
To hang from a tree

Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door

Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to hide outside your door
Boys, workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat

There's nothin' sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me

When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her


Boys, when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room but an empty crib

And I was burning up a fever
I didn't care much how long I lived
But I swear, I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did


When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her


When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her


My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me

When I was kissin' on my baby
And she'd put her love down, soft and sweet
In the low lamp light, I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me


When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her


When, my, time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It's not the song, it is the singing
It's the heaven of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the bearing of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising


And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power


It's not the wall, but what's behind it
Oh, the fear of fellow man, it's mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising


And I could cry power (Power), power (Power)
Oh, power
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry (Power) power, (Power) power
Hey, power
B.B. cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power


And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to
Rattle your chains if you love being free


But I could cry power (Power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Yeah ah, power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie, power
Dylan, power
Woody, power
Nina cried powerNone
I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths

Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene


Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh, I
Lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene


Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh


In leash-less confusion, I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
The jarring of judgement and reason's defeat the sweet
Heat of her breath in my mouth; I'm alive


With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

With her sweetened breath, and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine sceneNone
I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved


When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me


So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby


You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved


When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free


So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to prove
And nothin' to lose
Move me, baby


Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh baby, oh baby
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night


Move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Like you've nothin' left to lose
And nothin' to prove
Move me, baby
So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose


Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way


And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new


There's an art to life's distraction
To somehow escape the burning wait, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else; I guess any thrill will do


Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey, there is no right way


And so I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new


I wake at the first cringe of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha
That you would pray for him

'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day…


Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better

Love with every stranger
The stranger the better
Love with every stranger
The stranger the better


I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new

I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little, oh, a little bit
Every day with someone new
When I first saw you
The end was soon
To Bethlehem it slouched
And then, it must've caught a good look at you

Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you
The best of you
Honey, belongs to me


Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my baby?


Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

If I was born as a blackthorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you
Held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies

Ain't it warming you, the world gone up in flames?
Ain't it the life you, your lighting of the blaze?
Ain't it a waste they'd watch the throwing of the shade?
Ain't you my baby, ain't you my babe?

Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?


I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do

I knew that look, dear: eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know

So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do
So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
Soul deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine


She blows out of nowhere, a roman candle of the wild
Laughing her way through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight
And Lord, she found me just in time


'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young


She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues


Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by
Happy to lie back, watch it burn and rust
We tried the world; good God, it wasn't for us
She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

Cut clean from the dream that night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me in our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next

She's gonna save me, call me baby
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care

We'll steal a Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and bluesNoneNone
All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you

All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns, that all words in the fight fell to

Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby

And that day that we'll watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold and those jeans you have on
And you'll gaze unafraid as they sob from the city roofs


Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend, you are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby


When the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things that are seen and unseen
Not an end, but the start of all things that are left to do


Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you


That's itNone
I have never known peace
Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me


A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow


We'll lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found, to freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were, two corpses I saw


And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you


I have never known sleep
Like this slumber that creeps to me
I have never known colour
Like this morning reveals to me


And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold


We'll lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand, so still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land and worry the sheep


And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you...


They'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long we become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week (We lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle show fear (So long we become the flowers)


And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste


After the raven has had his say
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you, I'd be home with youNone
Honey, this club here is stuck up
Dinner and diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eyes
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talking type
I'd suffer Hell if you’d tell me
What you'd do to me tonight


Tell me
Tell me
Tell me, ah


That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreaming of
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of


Honey, I laugh when it sinks in
A pillar I am, upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinking
What you'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing what you'd do to me tonight

Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man

That's the kind of love
I’ve been dreaming of
That’s the kind of love
I've been dreaming of


(That’s the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised
And that kind of love
(That’s the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
Oh, let there be damage ensued and tabloid news
And that kind of love
(That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
Ah, oh-oh-oh, ah


That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
And that's the kind of love
I've been dreaming ofNoneNone
True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
A willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicoes
Over canopy dappled long ago
True that love in withdrawal was the weepin' of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
Fretted fire but that was long ago


It's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but that you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)


With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash, I saw rise in the heat
Settled soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose, I was never the same
Watching still-living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Layin' waste to my lovin' long ago


But that's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright, honey (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)


So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
As long as amber of ember glows
All the "would" that I'd loved is long ago


And it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (Oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (Oh, oh)
Of your blinding light (Oh, oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (Oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (Oh, oh)
And the fire bright (Oh, oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (Oh, oh)
Oh,  you're good to me, oh, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, you're good to me, you're good to me (Oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (Oh, oh)
I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus
When her body was found (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief
That drove him underground (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee
That made him turn around (Hey, yeah)
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me


I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you


I'd be the last shred of truth
In the lost myth of true love (Hey, yeah)
I'd be the sweet feeling of release
Mankind now dreams of (Hey, yeah)
That's found in the last witness
Before the wave hits, marvelling at God (Hey, yeah)
Before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me


I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (Hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out  (Hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' youNoneNoneNoneNone
There is a roadway, muddy and foxgloved
Whenever I'd have life enough, my heart is screamin' of
And in a few days I would be there, love
Whatever here that's left of me is yours just as it was


Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the flame


The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved


Tell me if somehow, some of it remains
How long you would wait for me?
And how long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now, your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Or just tell me 'bout your day


Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the shame


The highs hit the heights of my baby
And its hold had the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
And half as beautiful too
When all the worst we fear lets fall its weight
When the gyre widens on and when the wave breaks
When St. Peter loses cool and bars the gates
When Atlas acts the maggot, makes his arms shake
When the birds are heard again in their singin'
Once atrocity is hoarse from voicin’ shame
And when the earth is trembling on some new beginnin'
With the same sweet shock of when Adam first came


Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you’ve always been
(Lover, be good to me)


Be as you've always been (Lover, be good to me)
Be like the love that discovered the sin (Lover, be good to me)
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be that hopeful feeling when Eden was lost (Lover, be good to me)
It's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed (Lover, be good to me)
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
Oh, lover, be good to me


When the man who gives the order
Is born next time 'round on the boat sent back
When the bodies starvin' at the border
Are on TV givin' people the sack
Oh, when the sea rises to meet us
Oh, when there's nothin' left for you and I to do
Oh, when there’s nobody upstairs to receive us
When I have no kind words left, love for you


Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you’ve always been
Be, be, be, be, be
Be as you've always been
(Lover, be good to me)


Ah, be love in its disrepute (Lover, be good to me)
Scorches the hillside and salts every root (Lover, be good to me)
And watches the slowin’ and starvin' of troops
And, lover, be good to me (Lover, be good to me)
Be there and just as you stand (Lover, be good to me)
Or be like the rose that you hold in your hand (Lover, be good to me)
That will grow bold in a barren and desolate land
Oh, lover, be good to me


Love, won't you be
Love, won't you be
Be as you’ve always been?
Love, won't you be

Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that

Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps

Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to it
Honey, don't feed it, it will come back

You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better babe, you know better babe
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that

I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need

Don't let me in with with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to me
Honey, don't feed me, I will come back

It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you

Oh, please, give me mercy no more
That's a kindness you can't afford
I warn you, baby, each night, as sure as you're born
You'll hear me howling outside your door

Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?NoneNoneNoneYou've done
Me wrong
For a long
Long time

But after all
You've done
I never changed
My mind

Honey please
Try to love me
Honey please
Honey try
My love will never die

Flowers
Flowers grow
Where I'm laid
To rest

Honey pick
A blossom
And hold it
Hold it
To your breast

Honey you know
That's my love
Bursting loud
From inside

My love
Oh my love my love
Will never die
Any other day, I would call, you would say
"Baby, how's your day?"
But today, it ain't the same
Every other word is "uh-huh". “yeah ok"
Could it be that you are at the crib with another lady?
If you took it there, first of all, let me say
That I am not the one to sit around, and be played
So prove yourself to me, I'm the girl that you claim
Why don't you say the things that you said to me yesterday?


And I know you say that I am assuming things
(Something's going down that's the way it seems)
Shouldn't be the reason that you're acting strange
(Nobody's holding you back from me)
I know how you usually do
(Saying everything to me times two)
Why don't you just tell the truth?

What is up with this?
Tell the truth, who you with?
How would you like it if I came over with my clique?
Don't try to change it now, saying you gotta bounce
When two seconds ago, you said you just got in the house


And I know you say that I am assuming things

Tryin' hard to recognise
Some pure motive inside of me
A creature that would horrify
Any child that I used to be
Oh, give no faith to show
Started to smile so I showed my teeth
No more than flesh and bone
Doin' so much just to watch someone bleed


But I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always


Tryin' hard, I nearly find
Innocence in spite of me
Oh, creature that would terrify
Any child left inside of me
Oh, that's a cold insight
Nothin' above us and nothin' below
Ahh, but you might be right
If there is no heaven and there is no soul


I just love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Always, always, always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
It keeps its heat in spite of you
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me always
Oh, I love the very blood of you
Leaks and squeeks you black and blue
Oh, the heart that beats
To keep you here with me alwaysNone
It's not the waking, it's the rising
It is the grounding of a foot uncompromising
It's not forgoing of the lie
It's not the opening of eyes
It's not the waking, it's the rising


It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light, and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the waking, it's the rising


It’s not the talking it’s the doing
It’s the hand that yearns for work, in its renewing
Of the self each time you try
Of purpose and of pride
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising


It's not the song, it is the singing
It is the hearing of a human spirit ringing
It is the bringing of the line
It is the baring of the rhyme
It's not the waking, it's the rising

And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, oh
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power

And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, oh
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power


It’s not what’s in front but who’s beside you
It’s all that came before and what it provides you
All those that held the line
Who wouldn’t bow down and resign
It’s not the waking, it’s the rising


It's not the wall but what's behind it
The fear of fellow men, his mere assignment
And everything that we're denied
By keeping the divide
It's not the waking, it's the rising


And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Joni cried power

And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
James Brown cried power
Lennon cried power
Nina cried power


And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you
To rattle your chains if you love being free

I could cry power (power)
Power is my love when my love reaches to me
A perfect show of love
Any act of hope and love
In its actuality


I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Curtis cried power
(Dylan) Cried power
Marvin cried power

Cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Oh
Power

Nina cried powerI’d walk on cloven hoof if you were the home I was walking to
I’d burn every soul I knew if I thought the fire was warming you
I’d be what men fear in the woods
I’d piss on heaven’s gate if I could
I’m straight on the level
But I’d be the devil
As long as your lovin’ was goodNoneNoneOf all the money that e'er I had

So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They're sorry for my going away
And of all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They'd wish me one more day to stay
But as it falls unto my lot
That I must go and you must not
I gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
I'm out here lookin' like revenge
Feelin' like a ten, the best I've ever been
And, yeah, I know how bad it must hurt to see me like this
But it gets worse
Now, you're out here lookin' like regret, ain't too proud to beg
Second chance, you'll never get

Babe, there's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?
Babe, there's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me


No tired sigh, no rolling eyes, no irony
No "who cares?", no vacant stare, no time for me


Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming
Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to sit outside your door


Babe, there's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin?
Babe, there's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin


To the strand, a picnic planned for you and me
A rope in hand for your other man to hang from a tree


Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming
Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to sit outside your door


Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming

Mmm
God rest ye merry, gentlemen
Let nothing you dismay
Remember, Christ, our Savior
Was born on Christmas Day
To save us all from Satan's power
When we were gone astray
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy!


From God our Heavenly Father
A blessed angel came;
And unto certain shepherds
Brought tidings of the same:
How that in Bethlehem was born
The Son of God by Name
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy!

Now to the Lord sing praises
All you within this place (Sing praises)
And with true love and brotherhood
Each other now embrace (Brotherhood)
This holy tide of Christmas
All beauty in disgrace
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy
Oh, tidings of comfort and joy
Comfort and joy

Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya, I want you
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to, I want you
Tell me, tell me, baby, why can’t you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it, I want you

Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I’ve got (Ah)

One less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)
I got one less, one less problem (Oh-oh-oh)


And I know you're never gonna wake up, I have to give up, but it's you
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back, but it's you
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it, but it's you


Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got (Ah)
Ooh
Ooh, Ah

Got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem

If you know like I know
You don’t wanna step to this
It’s the G-Funk era
Funked out with a gangsta twist
If you smoke like I smoke
Then you high like everyday
And if your ass is a buster
213 will regulate

Got one less problem without ya (Oh-oh-oh)

I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird about it now
I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird about it now


Words hung above, but never would form
Like a cry at the final breath that is drawn
Remember me, love when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn


I'd no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is going with you now
Then when met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is going with you now


Dragging along, following your form
Hung like the pelt of some prey you had worn
Remember me love, when I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn


I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now


I was housed by your warmth
But I was transformed
By your grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me love, when I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp and glorious thorn
I still watch you when you're groovin'
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're movin' without movin'
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved

When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me

So move me, baby
Shake like the bough of a willow tree
Move me, baby
Nothin' to prove

You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
I know it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're S. Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequence
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'
And when you move, I'm moved




When you move
I can recall somethin' that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of somethin' so flawed and free

Please, remember me happily
By the rosebush laughing
With bruises on my chin, the time when
We counted every black car passing
Your house beneath the hill
And up until someone caught us in the kitchen
With maps, a mountain range, a piggy bank
A vision too removed to mention


But please, remember me fondly
I heard from someone you're still pretty
And then they went on to say
That the pearly gates
Had some eloquent graffiti
Like "We'll meet again" and "Fuck the man"
And "Tell my mother not to worry"
And angels with their great handshakes
Were always done in such a hurry


And please, remember me that Halloween
Making fools of all the neighbors
Our faces painted white
By midnight, we'd forgotten one another
And when the morning came I was ashamed
Only now it seems so silly
That season left the world and then returned
And now you're lit up by the city


So please, remember me mistakenly
In the window of the tallest tower
Calling passers-by but much too high
To see the empty road at happy hour
Gleam and resonate, just like the gates
Around the holy kingdom
With words like "Lost and found" and "Don't look down"
And "Someone save temptation"


And please, remember me as in the dream
We had as rug-burned babies
Among the fallen trees and fast asleep
Beside the lions and the ladies
That called you what you like and even might
Give a gift for your behavior
A fleeting chance to see a trapeze
Swinger high as any savior


But please, remember me, my misery
And how it lost me all I wanted
Those dogs that love the rain and chasing trains
The colored birds above their running
In circles around the well and where it spells
On the wall behind St. Peter
So bright, on cinder gray, in spray paint
"Who the hell can see forever?"


And please, remember me seldomly
In the car behind the carnival
My hand between your knees, you turned from me
And said, "The trapeze act was wonderful
But never meant to last", the clown that passed
Saw me just come up with anger
When it filled with circus dogs, the parking lot
Had an element of danger


So please, remember me finally
And all my uphill clawing
My dear, but if I make the pearly gates
I'll do my best to make a drawing
Of God and Lucifer, a boy and girl
An angel kissing on a sinner
A monkey and a man, a marching band
All around a frightened trapeze swinger
Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
Any rain softly kisses us on the face
Any wind means we're running
We can sleep and see 'em coming
Where we drift and call it dreaming
We can weep and call it singing


Where we break when our hearts are strong enough
We can bow 'cause our music's warmer than blood
Where we see enough to follow
We can hear when we are hollow
Where we keep the light we're given
We can lose and call it living


Where the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every night knows how long it's supposed to last
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say, before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine


Say it's here where our pieces fall in place
We can fear 'cause the feeling's fine to betray
Where our water isn't hidden
We can burn and be forgiven
Where our hands hurt from healing
We can laugh without a reason


'Cause the sun isn't only sinking fast
Every moon and our bodies make shining glass
Where the time of our lives is all we have
And we get a chance to say, before we ease away
For all the love you've left behind
You can have mine
She says, "Wake up, it's no use pretending"
I'll keep stealing, breathing her
Birds are leaving over autumn's ending
One of us will die inside these arms


Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our ashes 'round the yard


She says, "If I leave before you, darling
Don't you waste me in the ground"
I lay smiling like our sleeping children
One of us will die inside these arms


Eyes wide open
Naked as we came
One will spread our ashes 'round the yardNone
Mother don't worry
I killed the last snake that lived in the creek bed
Mother don't worry
I've got some money I saved for the weekend
Mother, remember being so stern
With that girl who was with me?
Mother, remember the blink of an eye
When I breathed through your body?


So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds
Flying upwards over the mountain


Mother, I made it up
From the bruise of a floor of this prison
Mother, I lost it
All of the fear of the Lord I was given
Mother forget me
Now that the creek drank the cradle you sang to
Mother forgive me
I sold your car for the shoes that I gave you


So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons could be birds
Taken broken up to the mountain


Mother, don't worry
I've got a coat and some friends on the corner
Mother, don't worry
She's got a garden we're planting together
Mother, remember the night
That the dog had her pups in the pantry?
Blood on the floor and the fleas on their paws
And you cried 'til the morning


So may the sunrise bring hope
Where it once was forgotten
Sons are like birds
Flying always over the mountain
Will you say when I'm gone away
"My lover came to me and we'd lay"?
In rooms unfamiliar but until now, oh-oh-oh-oh
Until now, oh-oh-oh-oh
Until now


Will you say to them when I'm gone
"I loved your son for his sturdy arms"?
We both learned to cradle then live without, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live without, oh-oh-oh-oh
Live without


Will you say when I'm gone away
"Your father's body was judgement day"?
We both dove and rose to the riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh
Riverside, oh-oh-oh-oh
Riverside


Will you say to me when I'm gone
"Your face has faded but lingers on"?
'Cause light strikes a deal with each coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh


Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night, oh-oh-oh-oh
Coming night
Lying in my bed, I hear the clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles, confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights almost left behind
Suitcases of memories, time after...
Sometimes you picture me, I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me, I can't hear what you've said
Then you say, "Go slow." I fall behind
The second hand unwinds


If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I'll be waiting
Time after time


After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows, you're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time


If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time


Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
A boy with a coin he found in the weeds
With bullets and pages of trade magazines
Close to a car that flipped on the turn
When God left the ground to circle the world


A girl with a bird she found in the snow
Then flew up her gown and that's how she knows
That God made her eyes for crying at birth
Then left the ground to circle the Earth


A boy with a coin he crammed in his jeans
Then making a wish he tossed in the sea
Walked to a town that all of us burn
When God left the ground to circle the world
There are times that walk from you
Like some passing afternoon
Summer warmed the open window of her honeymoon
And she chose a yard to burn
But the ground remembers her
Wooden spoons, her children stir her Bougainvillea blooms


There are things that drift away
Like our endless numbered days
Autumn blew the quilt right off the perfect bed she made
And she's chosen to believe
In the hymns her mother sings
Sunday pulls its children from their piles of fallen leaves


There are sailing ships that pass
All our bodies in the grass
Springtime calls her children 'til she lets them go at last
And she's chosen where to be
Though she's lost her wedding ring
Somewhere near her misplaced jar of Bougainvillea seeds


There are things we can't recall
Blind as night that finds us all
Winter tucks her children in, her fragile china dolls
But my hands remember hers
Rolling 'round the shaded ferns
Naked arms, her secrets still like songs I'd never learned


There are names across the sea
Only now I do believe
Sometimes, with the windows closed, she'll sit and think of me
But she'll mend his tattered clothes
And they'll kiss as if they know
A baby sleeps in all our bones, so scared to be alone
Give me your hand
The dog in the garden row is covered in mud
And dragging your mother's clothes
Cinder and smoke
The snake in the basement
Found the juniper shade
The farmhouse is burning down


Give me your hand
And take what you will tonight
I'll give it as fast
And high as the flame will rise
Cinder and smoke
Some whispers around the trees
The juniper bends
As if you were listening


Give me your hand
Your mother is drunk
As all the firemen shake
A photo from father's arms
Cinder and smoke
You asked me to pray for rain
With ash in your mouth
You'll ask it to burn againNoneNone
Tonight we're the sea and the salty breeze
The milk from your breast is on my lips
And lovelier words from your mouth to me
When salty my sweat and fingertips


Our hands they seek the end of afternoons
My hands believe and move over you
Ahhaaaaaaa...  Ahhaaaaaaa...
Ahhaaaaaaa...  Ahhaaaaaaa...
Ahhaaaaaaa...  Ahhaaaaaaa...


Tonight, we're the sea and the rhythm there
The waves and the wind and night is black
Tonight we're the scent of your long black hair
Spread out like your breath across my back


Your hands they move like waves over me
Beneath the moon, tonight, we're the sea
Ahhaaaaaaa...  Ahhaaaaaaa...
Ahhaaaaaaa...  Ahhaaaaaaa...
Ahhaaaaaaa...  Ahhaaaaaaa...NoneNoneNoneWho's seen Jezebel?
She was born to be the woman I would know
And hold like the breeze
Half as tight as both eyes closed

Who's seen Jezebel?
She went walking where the cedars line the road
Her blouse on the ground
Where the dogs were hungry, roaming

Saying, "wait, we swear
We'll love you more and wholly
Jezebel, it's we, we that you are for
Only"

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was born to be the woman we could blame
Make me a beast half as brave
I'd be the same

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was gone before I ever got to say
"Lay here my love
You're the only shape I'll pray to, Jezebel"

Who's seen Jezebel?
Will the mountain last as long as I can wait
Wait like the dawn
How it aches to meet the day

Who's seen Jezebel?
She was certainly the spark for all I've done
The window was wide
She could see the dogs come running

Saying, "wait, we swear
We'll love you more and wholly
Jezebel, it's we, we that you are for
Only"Our winter keeps running us down
We wake up with love hanging on
Killers let go, killers let go

Some kids get a handful of rain
Our hope is the desperate die wise
Killers let go, killers let go

Morning falls from a tree and asks for a name
Claim your ghost, know the wine for what it is

The garden grows into our street
We're holding the blossoms up high
Killers let go, killers let go

Claim your ghost, know the wine for what it is
There's light holding onto the ground
Our music is clumsy and free
Killers let go, killers let go

Killers let go, our killers let go
Our killers let go, killers let go
Our killers let go, killers let go
A weed believes the garden
Sunday clothes don't fool me
The sky is full of our prayer, prayer
When you were making moonlight
The mall cops in Mobile
The night fell from their eyes, from their eyes
This is borrowed stone
I'd help you let your hair down
Point to birds, then you'd say, "Bang, bang"
The sun left every evening
Good grass was dying
You drew your dawn on the world, on the world


Tenderness to you was only talk about a bruise
Or walking into water after dark


Your papa saw me coming
Blood knows when it's worth it
All you said, you said like a song, a song
Jesus left a best friend
Mine says forget her
His field is waiting for wind, for the wind
Mobile had your moonlight
But the line cook had candy
You let him blow your candle a bit
(Hoo hoo hoo, hahaha)
Ring a bell that's broken
That sound is loud inside us
Flowing farther away, far away


Tenderness to you was only talk about a bruise
Or walking into water after dark


Love can last a lifetime
This is Alabama
And a wheel is forgiving the road, the road
Now you're making music
For beautiful people by the sea
Who don't need a song, need a song


Tenderness to you was only talk about a bruise
This is Alabama
Let's forget whatever we lost
Rolling around in the weeds
Finding ourselves broken
Looking for light on the floor


Let's become the lovers we want
Banging our heads in the fog
Flowers will close and open
Life going by like we care


One day it's whatever we made (Whatever we made)
From pieces off the side of a road (Whatever we made)
Marked on our map of what hurts
And what hurts worse


Let's become the lovers we need
Who knew we'd be needing so much
We keep finding ourselves broken
Tossed in the yard with the bones

And let's forget whatever we know
Knowing all too little, too late
Laying down in our own horizon
Letting that water hit home


Let's become the lovers we want
(Let's become the lovers we want)
Let's become the lovers we need
(Let's become the lovers we need)
Let's become the lovers we want

By the end, we'll take music from them both
Give it back, shining broken glass

Wedding coat, I was waiting there for you
You raised your glass and the scars fell off my heart
We threw a stone, but we never heard it land
There are clouds keeping quiet every night

By the end, we hold something too high to ever come back down
By the end, there's a song we will sing meant for someone else
By the end, we leave somewhere too long to ever wander back
By the end, we give someone too much to ever close their hand

Summer clouds doing good for gold and gray
Tell me where all this love fits in the world
You can lie, give me all the rain you want
Songbirds in the morning had my head
Lost in the tall trees I knew well
Well, I would say, dreaming my dry weeds


Stray light finds its way to all of us
Say something green, it comes back
Sunlight on my lips, let 'em kiss dark leaves


Let the hands of the wrong prophets heal me all they should
Let the wine of the poison Jesuses taste good
And all those trees lay down
If you were a bird and fell into my arms


If I wrote your song in stone
If I wore your wings back home
Would the dreams in the backwater drown us far from harm?


Give this to the gray, it comes back gold
Birds of the morning, they may know
Know more than us, giving their hymns for life


Let the waves on the wrong water say what they will say
While the wind and the broken branches float me away
All tall trees lay down if you were the bird who fell into my arms


I could write your song in stone
I could wear your wings back home
Would the dreams in the backwater drown us far from harm?None

Coffee to taste, crossword puzzles to ponder and I

Be this sunset soon forgotten
Your brothers left here shaved and crazy
We’ve learned to hide our bottles in the well
And what's worth keeping, sun still sinking


Down and down
Once again
Down and down
Gone again


Be this sunset, one for keeping

When you hear like you're alone
The rusty gears of morning
And faceless, busy phones
We gladly run in circles
But the shape we meant to make is gone

And love is a tired symphony
You hum when you're awake
And love is a crying baby
Mama warned you not to shake
And love's the best sensation
Hiding in the lion's mane

So I'll clear the road, the gravel
And the thorn bush in your path
That burns a scented oil
That I'll drip into your bath
The water's there to warm you
And the earth is warmer
When you laugh

And love is the scene I render
When you catch me wide awake
And love is a dream you enter
Though I shake and shake and shake you
And love's the best endeavor
Waiting in the lion's maneMary Ann, do you remember
The tree by the river
When we were seventeen?

The dark canyon wall, the call and the answer
And the mare in the pasture
Pitch black and baring its teeth

I recall the sun in our faces
Stuck and leaning on graces
And being strangers to change

The radio and the bones we found frozen
And all the thorns and the roses
Beneath your windowpane

Now I'm asleep in a car
I mean the world to a potty-mouth girl
And a pretty pair of blue-eyed birds

Time isn't kind or unkind, you liked to say
But I wonder to who
And what it is you're saying today

Happy just to be with you
And you were happy for meNone
In this autumn town where the leaves can fall
On either side of the garden wall
We laugh all night to keep the embers glowing


Some are leaping free from their moving cars
Stacking stones 'round their broken hearts
Waving down any wind that might come blowing


Mice move out when the field is cut
Serpents curl when the sun comes up
Songbirds only end up where they're going


Some get rain and some get snow
Some want love and some want gold
I just want to see you in the morning


Dogs lay down in the evening heat
Fish do worse when they leave the sea
Songbirds only end up where they're going


In this autumn town where the lights can change
Some get mercy and some get blame
Some get lost when they feel the river flowing


It's all holy smoke and the flame dies fast
We hold our hats while the days fly past
Cold wind comes and we wave but it keeps going


Fathers, Sons and Holy Ghosts
All come back or they all come close
Songbirds only end up where they're going


Some get hard and some go home
Some want flesh and some want bone
I just want to see you in the morning


Yeah, I just want to see you in the morning
Someone gets to be the river, someone is the sea
Someone gets to be the fire, someone is the leaves
And someone's walking in the morning light and calling to it cold
Everybody moves beneath the truest stars they know


Jesus and his trophy wives are praying for the suicides and the orphans
Save us all from what we want, beautiful and beaten back to life


Someone has the door to heaven, someone has the lock
Someone has to be the dove when someone is the hawk
And someone's talking to the miles around and hearing them for good
Everybody's branches falling harder than they should


And I know Jesus and his trophy wives are praying for the broken to be noticed
Save us all from what we want, beautiful and beaten back to life

Last night to lie in these arms


It's the giving the wind all it wants
For turn after turn till we're lost
And it's what we believe in the limbs of hometown trees
When we let go, we'll disappear


It's our last night to lie in these arms
Last night to lie in these arms
Last night to lie in these arms


It's the finding our clothes behind the door
Dreaming the light in our dark house
The sound of our hearts and cars passing by


It's our last night to lie in these arms
Last night to lie in these arms
Last night to lie in these armsNone
Leave the waves of Galveston but only if you can

Papa left you for Heaven after your Mama lost her song
And though your baby left you for Houston, no one stays there very long


There's a graveyard by the pizza parlor, a gate that only closes
Snowbirds fly away like secrets no one really wants to know
The climbing moon's always shining on the kind of shells you keep
The broken horse tied to the water tower's running in his sleep


It's too bad that you ain't got a soft place to fall
It's too bad Texas leans to the least of us all
And says, “If you can make the music then you can have the dance
If you can shoot the pistol then you can wear the pants”


So leave the waves of Galveston but only if you can
'Cause it's the only place the Lone Star kind have offered you a hand
Your baby left you nothing but a dog she left for dead
You never knew you were a burden 'til it hit you on the head


It's too bad that you ain't got a soft place to fall
It's too bad Texas leans to the least in us all
And says, “If you can make the music then you can have the dance
If you can shoot the pistol then you can wear the pants”
When the men take me to the devil tree
I will be free and shining like before
Papa, don't tell me what I should've done
She's the one, she's the one who begged me
"Take me, take me home"

When the wind wraps me like the reaper's hand
I will swing free until they cut me down
Papa, don't tell me what I could've done
She's the one, she's the one who begged me
"Take me, take me home"

When the sea takes me like my mother's arms
I will breathe free as any word of God
Papa, don't tell me what you would've done
She's the one, she's the one who begged me
"Take me, take me home"None
And when you give me your clothes
And when we're lovers at last
Fresh air, perfume in your nose


There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass


And when you give me your house
When we're all brothers at last
There will be food in our mouths


There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass


And when there's nothing to want
When we're all brilliant and fast
When all tomorrows are gone


There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
There will be teeth in the grass
Know this house that I called home
Her gentle milk was happy just to flow
Know that her tomcats took their licks in turn
Some branches fall to open arms
Some paradises are a prayer too far
Gods in the treetop making mockingbirds

If I could choose I would do things right
Teach my dreams to look me in the eye
Sing my heart out into my hand
Shine where light demands


When I lose my feet in my father's shoes
When I take your flesh with my false tooth
When I bend until I break in two
Call me a fool being green
In the leaves of the world
The leaves of the world


The wind blows all the wild away
This house was kind as every hiding place
Bones are the hardest offering to burn
That dog will bark though no one's there
This man went mad breaking his easy chair
Sing me the softest heart I've ever heard

It's only right how this trail goes cold
Moonlight gliding through our empty clothes
Know I'm warm when a cloud rolls by
Rolling right for sky


When I lose my feet in my father's shoes
When I take your flesh with my false tooth
When I bend until I break in two
Call me a fool being green
In the leaves of the world
The leaves of the worldThere is a house by the sea
Two jealous sisters, they're waiting for me
And one is laid on the floor
And one is changing the locks on the doors
And I've been buying the time on my knees
And I've been selling their blankets to bleed on

Around the house by the sea
The scent of roses and raspberry leaves
And there is smoke in my clothes
Too much time with just smoke in my nose
And I've been making the meaning they lack
And I've been burning that book they come back to

There is a house by the sea
And an ocean between it and me
And like the shape of a wave
The jealous sisters will sing on my grave
And I've been living to run where they led
And I've been dying to rise from their bed
And I've been sparing my neck from their chain
And they've been changing the sound of my name
And I've been swimming to them in my sleep
And I've been dreaming our love and our freedom
Deep inside the heart of this troubled man
There's itty bitty boy tuggin' hard at your hand
Born bitter as a lemon, but you must understand
That you've been bringin' me joy

And I only lie when you don't want the truth
I'm only frightened cause you finally gave me somethin' to lose
And it's as loud as a thunderclap and you hear it too
But you've been bringin' me joy


La la la, ooh, lala lala la, la, lala, la, nah nah


Deep inside the heart of this crazy mess
I'm only calm when I get lost within your wilderness
Born crooked as a creek bed, I've come to confess
That you've been bringin' me joy

Well I'm in love, I'm livin' for you
When all the bluebirds dyin' but they're singin' the blues
It's a heartfelt silly sort of bumblin' tune
But how you're bringin' me joy


La la la, ooh, lala lala la, la, lala, la, nah nah
Ooh
Sunday morning, my Rebecca sleepin' in with me again
There's a kid outside the church kickin' a can
When the cedar branches twist she turns her collar to the wind
The weather can close the world within its hand

And my mother says Rebecca is as stubborn as they come
They both call to me with words I never knew
There's a bug inside the thimble, there's a band-aid on her thumb
And a pony in the river turning blue


They say, "Time may give you more than your poor bones could ever take"
My Rebecca says she never wants a boy
To be barefoot on the driveway as they wave and ride away
Then to run inside and curse the open door


I once gave to my Rebecca a belated promise ring
And she sold it to the waitress on a train
I may find her by the phone but with a fashion magazine
She may kiss me when her girlfriends leave again


They say, "Time may give you more than your poor bones could ever take"
I think I could never love another girl
To be free atop a tree stump and to look the other way
While she shines my mother's imitation pearls


Sunday evenin' my Rebecca's lost a book she never read
And the moon already fell into the sea
Saw the statues of our fathers in the courthouse flower bed
Now they blend with all the lightnin'-tattered trees


They say, "Time may give you more than your poor bones could ever take"
My Rebecca said she knew I'd want a boy
A dollar for my boardwalk red balloon to float away
She would earn a pocketful to buy me more


Dun, dun dun, dun dun
Du-dun dun dun dun dun dun
Dun, du-dun, dun du-dun
Du-dun dun dun dun dun dun
May your eyes be wide and seein'
May you learn from the view where you're kneelin'
Know the fear of the world that you're feelin'
Is the fear of a slave

May you know how the fight was started
Want as much for the snake as the garden
Wear 'em both like a glove that you can't wain


May your mouth betray your wisdom
May you get what they fail to mention
May your love be your only religion
Preach it to us all

May you lose what you offer gladly
May you worship the time and it's passin'
Stars won't ever wait for you to watch 'em fall


We're the smoke on a burned horizon
We're the boat on a tide that's risin'
Both the post and the pig you're untyin'
The butcher gone for the blade

Someday we may all be happy
Someday all make a face worth slappin'
Someday we may be shocked to be laughin'
At the way we behave


May your hands be strong and willin'
May you know when to speak and to listen
May you find every friend that you're missin'
There's no check in the mail

May you end there bruised and purple
Know that peace is the shape of a circle
'Round and 'round you go
Bitin' your tail


Little children, the wind is whippin'
Short hands on a clock still tickin'
Both the egg and the red fox grinnin'
His belly full for the day

Someday we may all want nothin'
And all forget that we'll get what's comin'
Someday I'll say the world was somethin'
That we just couldn't change


May your tongue be somethin' wicked
Know your part in the calf and the killin'
See straight through the captain you're kissin'
Helm loose in his hand

May your words be well worth stealin'
Put your hand on your heart when singin'
The choir's sick of the song but they've still gotta standNone
Almost home when I missed the bottom stair
You were braidin' your gray hair
It had grown so long
Since I'd been gone

And the perfect girls by the pool, they would protest
The cross around their necks
But our sons were overseas
And we all know 'bout the hive and the honeybees


Almost home with an olive branch and a dove
You were beating on a Persian rug
With your Bible and your wedding band
Both hidden on the TV stand

When a cruel wind blew every city father fell
Off the county carousel
While the dogs were eating snow
All our sons had sunk in a trunk of Noah's clothes


Almost home and got lost on our new street
While your grievin' girls all died in their sleep
So the dogs all went unfed
A great dream of bones all piled on the bed

And the cops couldn't care when that crackhead built a boat
And said, "Please, before I go
May our only honored bond
Be the kinship of the kids in the riot squad"NoneNone
Blue light sittin' lotus-style on your A-frame in the countryside
Stillness slides the door and walks inside
Candle on the windowsill burned wickless through our low-lit meal
Heaven only knows the things you hide


In your blue eyes
And your sly smile


Tangerine on both your hands smells strong as the tobacco can
Roll me up a smoke if you don't mind
Touch me like that afternoon when your friends would all be over soon
And you said, "What the hell, we'll make the time"


With your blue eyes
And your sly smileNoneNoneNone
Wolves by the road and a bike wheel spinning on a pawn shop wall
She'll wring out her colored hair like a butterfly beaten in a summer rainfall
And then roll on the kitchen floor of some fucker with a pocketful of foreign change
The song of the shepherd's dog
A ditch in the dark in the ear of the lamb, who's gonna try to run away?
Whoever got that brave?


Wolves in the middle of town and the chapel bell ringing through the windblown trees
She'll wave to the butcher's boy with the parking lot music everybody believes
And then dive like a dying bird at any dude with a dollar at the penny arcade
The song of the shepherd's dog
The waiter and the check or the rooster on a rooftop waitin' for day
And you know what he's going to say


Wolves at the end of the bed and a postcard hidden in her winter clothes
She'll weep in the back of a truck to the traitors only trying to find her bullet hole
And then run down a canopy road to some mother and a baby with a cross to bear
The song of the shepherd's dog
A little brown flea in the bottle of oil for your wooly wild hair
You'll never get him out of thereTime and all you gave
I was the jerk who preferred the sea
To tussling in the waves
Tugging your skirt singing please, please, please

Now I see love
Tracked on the floor where you walked outside
Now I seek love
Looking for you in this other girl's eyes

Time and all you took
Only my freedom to fuck the whole world
Promising not to look
Promising light on the sidewalk girls

Now I see love
There in your car where I said those things
Now I see love
Tugging your skirt singing please, please, please

Time and all you gave
There on your cross that I never saw
Well beyond the waves
Dunking my head when I heard you call

Now I see love
There in the scab where you pinched my leg
Now I see love
There on your side of my empty bedNoneNoneNone
And meet me there
Bundles of flowers
We'll wade through the hours of cold
Winter, she'll howl at the walls
Tearing down doors of time
Shelter as we go

And promise me this
You'll wait for me only
Scared of the lonely arms
Surface, far below these burns

And maybe, just maybe, I'll come home

Oh, who am I, darling to you?
Who am I?
Will tell you stories of mine
Who am I?

Oh, who am I, darling for you?
Who am I?
Will be a burden in time, lonely
Who am I to you?


And who am I, darling for you?
Who am I?
Will be a burden
And who am I, darling to you?
Who am I?


I come alone here
I come alone hereNone
I spent my time watchin'
The spaces that have grown between us
And I cut my mind on second best
Or the scars that come with the greenness

And I gave my eyes to the bottom
Still the seabed wouldn't let me in
And I tried my best
To embrace the darkness in which I swim


I'm walkin' back down this mountain
With the strength of a turnin' tide
Oh the wind's so soft and my skin
And the sun so hard upon my side

Oh lookin' out at this happiness
I search for between the sheets
Oh, feelin' blind and realize
All I was searchin' for was me

Oh, oh-oh, all I was searchin' for was me...


Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin'

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong


I saw a friend of mine the other day
And he told me that my eyes were gleamin'
Oh, I said I had been away
And he knew, oh, he knew the depths I was meanin'

And it felt so good to see his face
All the comfort invested in my soul
Oh, to feel the warmth of a smile
When he said, "I'm happy to have you home

Oh, oh-oh, I'm happy to have you home"


Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long
Oh my, my darlin'

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no
Keep your mind set in your ways
And keep your heart strong


'Cause I'll always remember you the same
Oh, eyes like wild flowers, oh, with your demons of change...


(Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
May you find happiness there (Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
(Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
May all your hopes all turn out right (Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)


Keep your head up, keep your heart strong
No, no, no, no (Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
Keep your mind set, keep your hair long (Keep your head up, keep your heart strong)
Oh my, my darlin'

Keep your head up, keep your heart strong

Keep your mind set in your ways

Oh, eyes like wild flowers, oh, with your demons of changeNoneNone
Black flies on the windowsill
That we are
That we are
That we are to know
Winter stole summer's thrill
And the river's cracked and cold
See the sky is no man's land
A darkened plume to stay
Hope here needs a humble hand
Not a fox found in your place


And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone


Black flies on the windowsill
That we are
That we are
That we are to hold
Comfort came against my will
And every story must grow old
Still I'll be a traveler
A gypsy's reins to face
But the road is wearier
With that fool found in your place


And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone
And no man is an island, oh this I know
But can't you see, oh?
Maybe you were the ocean, when I was just a stone

So here we are


And I don't wanna beg your pardon
And I don't wanna ask you why
But if I was to go my own way
Would I have to pass you by?
And I don't wanna beg your pardon
And I don't wanna ask you why
But if I was to go my own way
Would I have to pass you by?
The end of the after
The weight of a war
The kindness gone to bed

The weight of your laughter
Alive in the hall
Did he hear, did he hear
The fumbled words you said


Living without her
Living at all
Seems to slow me down
Living forever
Hell, I don't know
Do I care, do I care
The thunder's rumbled sound


And now I watch her
Running round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends


The end of the after
The weight of a war
The kindness gone to bed

The threat of your laughter
Alive after all
Did he hear, did he hear
The fumbled words you said


Living without her
Living at all
Seems to slow me down
Living forever
Pale light on all
Do I care, do I care
The thunder's rumbled sound


Now I watch her running round in love again
Now I talk about you when I'm with our mutual friends

Could you be, could you be alone?
My hatred, my hate will bring me closer


This is it?
Well this is desert
And what of him?
What the hell love
Darling, you're with me, always around me
Only love, only love

Only love, only love

Oh my mind!
I walk down Mayflower Road again
The wailing sun
Echoes from the park seem so absurd

The bus takes hours
I knew it would
But I can't shake the sting
Can't spend my time
On everybody else

If buildings fell
At least we'd be in matrimony
I can't control
The words kaleidoscope inside my head


Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me
Is it all so very bad?
I can't see
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me


I saw the police
Screaming something trivial
Like 'keep the peace!'
The world moves on and you can't shake the sound

I know she's home
Waiting on somebody
Loathe in light
All in my mind
The anvil and the weight upon my back

 x2
Has the world gone mad
Or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me
Gather round me
Is it all so very bad?
I can't see
All these small things they gather round me
Gather around me

And I can't see my love

Has the world gone mad or is it me?
All these small things they gather round me, gather round me
Is it all so very bad? I can't see...
All these small things they gather round me, gather around me

When everything around you's
Changing like the weather
A big black storm
And who would you turn to?
Hide a ghost, a shadow at the most
Would you let me know?

Cause I don't want to trouble your mind with
The childish design of how it all should go
But I love you so
When it all comes clear
When the wind is settled
I'll be here, you know

Cause you said ours were the lighthouse towers
The sun upon that place
Darling I'll grow weary, happy still
With just the memory of your face

Gracious goes the ghost of you
And I will never forget the plans and the
Silhouettes you drew here, no
And gracious goes the ghost of you, my dear

How would you know?
When everything around you's
Bruised and battered
Like the cold night storm
And who would you turn to?
Well, had I a ghost, a shadow at the most, would you tell me so?

Cause I, I adore you so

The wind is settled, I'll be here, you know

These windows
Where we sat together

Like nothing ever
Happened here, oh
Oh, the white house on the hill
Black clouds the weather


And the church spire
Over the river
She still sits there, warm
In the evening glow

But you don't care about
All these scenes I treasure
Well, these west winds
I know, I know


Seems everything around here
Stays like stone
Seems it's about time, darling
About time we let this all go

O lost, to these memories
We found

But she'll be here
When it's all done
When our bodies are lain
Beneath the ground


Seems everything that goes around
Comes, comes around here
Seems everything that stays here
Somehow, gets me down again

What have I done with my years?


Well I walked out Sunday morning
To watch the weather blow through the trees
It’s so nice to be around you now
Fill the days with aching breeze

Put a rose upon my table, dear
Put a leaf inside my door
It’s so nice to be around you now
Fill the days with asking more

And I said to me
I would like to be
Someone
Kind over cavalier
What have I done with my years?I don't need nobody
No, I
I don't need nobody
Oh, I don't need nobody
To be alone
To be alone

And in the darkness a shallow poison
And it has grown
I bite my tongue, there's a fever
I will not let it go

I don't need nobody
No, I
I don't need nobody
Oh, I don't need nobody
To be alone

I bite my tongue, there's a fever
I will not let it show

Go find
Someone else
I am not ready to die
Go whisper softly
To someone else
Ask them
To lie
Down


You can tell them I'll be back in a minute
Oh now is not the time
I was there already I think
As a child
But I really can't remember why


Someone in the doorway
Someone in the light
Someone through the wall always
Someone left outside


Go find
Someone else
I am not ready to decide
Go whisper softly
To the man with no time
Ask him to pick sides


Tell them I'll be back in a minute
Oh now is not the time
Gone to find the root they all chewed on
For millennia
Do something better with my time


Someone in the doorway
Someone in the light
Someone in my hallway
Someone wearing a new hat
Someone on the floor outside
They say you don't come back from that


Into the light of a bad dream
Into the laughter of a war
England the sedative on my tongue
Goodbye
Goodbye
That's all
Goodbye
Goodbye
That's allNoneOh your brown eyes shine a sure light on the way to go
And the sun tries you, reeling home against your glow
And we lost sight of it, breath tied up in summer’s hold
And your eyes screamed it
Burgh Island, in sepia tones

And if I was ever to leave, I'd say before I go
That you're the best woman I have ever known

Oh your brown eyes shine a sure light on the way to go
And the sun chides you
So long
And we lost sight of it, breath tied up in summer’s hold
And the world break for it
Burgh Island, in sepia tones

And if I was ever to leave, I'll say before I go
That you're the best woman I have ever known


Oh I bite my tongue
That you may be the first to ruin
‘cause I heard it sung
That man is a fickle child
The wind blew in
The one blowing

Oh I bite my tongue
That you may be the first to ruin
‘cause I heard it sung
That man is a fickle child
The wind blew in
Baby wants to dance
Past the flat-footed charterhouse boys
From towns where the mothers can't stand
The sight of each other
Baby wants to last
In the hearts of the wild and free
She knows that time takes all of us
Through every long hot heavy summer


And all of them, they talk of national security
Over garden fences made to buff the bastard breeze
Of chance encounters


Baby wants to dance
Past the Tuesday morning supermarket crowd
She knows we'll all sleep through the days
The Two-step drip fed our laughter
Says she wants to last
Last how you want to
She's a light in the young boy's eyes
Through every long hot heavy summer


And all of them, they talk of national security
Over garden fences made to buff the bastard breeze
Yeah all of them, shuffling down that lonely street
One last gasp
Against a long hot heavy summerNone
All I am is the bones you made for me
So garishly clean
White as the horses
That carry me away...

All my demons, you said, come and go with the days
A mind's will to play
I grow old in my way
Oh, just like you do...


Oh, there ain't no diamonds in the boredom
Oh, there ain't no darkness that I fear
Oh, there ain't no way to say I love you more, no
So be clear, just to be clear

So be clear, be clear...


All I am is the bones you made for me
Just driftwood for the sea
Heavy as the horses
That carry me away...

Mm, ah, that carry me away!

No, there ain't no darkness that I fear

So be clear, be clear...NoneNoneShe's got a little house in town
I sometimes go around, there
To see her
And she let me deep inside
I sing her love songs
But she'll turn them blind
Like she ain't the sentimental type
I keep my heart in my pocket and I hold
I hold it tight

I know that she don't mind if I
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if I'm absent through it all

I know that she don't mind if I
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if I'm absent through it all
Through it all
Through it all

Her skin is softer than the bluest eyes
With the warmth that I need

Gives me a place
To hide from the streetlights burning through the bedroom window
In the shadows yeah there's loneliness we cling to
When the morning comes
We'll go, we'll go our separate ways
Ain't no magic here, ain't no reason to stay

I know that she don't mind if I
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if I'm absent through it all

I know that she don't mind if I
Go away and I don't call
I know that she don't mind if I'm absent through it all

And we talk in useless metaphors
Yeah we fall through empty corridors
And we talk in useless metaphors
And we fall through empty corridors
And we talk in useless metaphorsI lie in your charms
Though it harms the best of me
And I lie on to my friends to them
No wonder why I wait for thee

And I hope like a child
Widow of the sea

All's around me

Will you be there
Under the same, under the same sun
Under the same, under the same sun

Lalalala lovely as you are
Lalalala lovely as you are
Lalalala lovely as you areOh you screamed hallelujah darling
Startled all the sleeping starlings on the wire

As we walked up the footpath through the fields
How the rain did reveal your heart
And the rope swing from the balance held the weight
Shadows fall and a cold wind blows
And you said "oh, maybe we're just lost souls here
Maybe-oh everybody goes."

Oh but we were
Young oh-ho we were young
Ooh we were young
Oh-ho we were young

Still don't, don't you forget
That rope you tied around your neck
Don't free you darlin', oh oh-ho oh ho oh
Ooh don't free you darlin', oh oh ho oh ho oh

And it took them three days to find you
Tired torch lights and dog scents
Oh they let you down from the highest branches
Cold eyes and frozen arms
And my my my your beauty was so dumbfoundin'
Lace white dress and your hair as long as Follaton Woods

And the whole town just stood there crying
Looking at the darkness
For something wholesome and good
Oh good, oh-ho oh oh
Oh good, oh-ho oh oh

Still don't, don't you forget
That rope you tied around your neck
Don't free you darlin', oh oh-ho oh ho oh
Don't free you darlin', oh oh-ho oh ho oh



Morning white mist came in across the plains
Blue skies and rain
Oh and it was the strangest day
People taking cover, people holding shame

And you woulda left your heart ah-ah oh oh
Oh you woulda left your heart, ah-ha oh ho
You woulda left your heart, ah-ha ou-out
You woulda laughed your heart, ah-ha ou-out

You woulda laughed your heart out.*

*The final lines seem to shift gradually from "you woulda left your heart" to "you woulda laughed your heart out"Oh my ghost came by
Said who do you love the most
Who you wanna call before you die

Oh my ghost came by here
Said who do you love the most
Who you gonna sing to 'fore you're gone

Am I in your light?
Am I forced beside you?
Am I in your heart?


All my friends they
Let me know
I've a fickle mind
Before the shows
I've a brittle tongue
It comes and goes
I've a fascination
With all I cannot control

Am I in your light?
Am I forced beside you?

Comes, comes around again
The faces you see on the way up
Are those on the way back down, my friend
But you've been climbing shoulders around you
Trying to reach the big blue sky
And all above you is just the blackness, darling
And everything below you dies
And everything below you dies

You've been growing up
You've been growing on
Further away from us now


And nobody gives a fuck about you
Tell you it's a damn shame
The prettiest eyes in the whole world
The same fool in the same game
The same fool in the same game

You've been growing up
You've been growing on
Further away from us now
Keep it steady
For the one I love the most
All eyes on radar
See the Queen of the coast
Yeah keep it steady
A hand to hold in quiet times
All eyes on radar
Got me fooled before I die

Yeah keep it steady
For the one I love the most
Their eyes on radar
Want to see the Queen of the coast
Oh keep it steady
A hand to hold in hard times
Oh I'm on her radar
I'll follow her 'till I die

But if you go
Before these waters turn to stone
Then I'm going on
Yeah I'm going on

Keep it steady
For the one I love the most
All eyes on radar
See the Queen of the coast
Oh keep it steady
A hand to hold in hard times
Oh she's my lady
Oh she's the woman on my mind

But if you go
'fore these waters turn to stone

I said it was grieving, you said it don't feel nothing

I bet you think everything's in its rightful place

That sentiment is man's disgrace

Well the rooks in the trees they dont half bother me

Clawing at my mind with every given opportunity

It's spring outside, a perilous sky, and that terrible clattering sound

Fuck it you said, you should go shoot them down

So hey, that's me

Shooting at a 100 year old rookery

Oh look at me

The definition of futility

It's what you say anyway

So I'll go back to working through the gentle hours of the evening

Where the weather and the wine and the company treats me easily

Unknowing am I of the wound that took my eye

Unknowing am I of the wound

Unknowing am I of the wound that took my eye

Unknowing am I of the wound
From walking home and talking loads
To seeing shows in evening clothes with you
From nervous touch and getting drunk
To staying up and waking up with you


Now we're sleeping near the edge
Holding something we don't need
All this delusion in our heads
Is gonna bring us to our knees


So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me


From throwing clothes across the floor
To teeth and claws and slamming doors at you
If this is all we're living for
Why are we doing it, doing it, doing it anymore?


I used to recognize myself
It's funny how reflections change
When we're becoming something else
I think it's time to walk away


So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me


Tryna fit your hand inside of mine
When we know it just don't belong
'Cause no force on earth could make it feel right, no, no
Tryna push this problem up the hill
When it's just too heavy to hold
I think now's the time to let it slide


So, come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
Everything that's broke, leave it to the breeze
Let the ashes fall, forget about me


Come on, let it go, just let it be
Why don't you be you, and I'll be me?
And I'll be me
(Ooh, me, you)
Sometimes I'm beaten
Sometimes I'm broke
‘Cause sometimes this city is nothing but smoke
Is there a secret?
Is there a code?
Can we make it better?
'Cause I'm losing hope


Tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us


After the wreckage
After the dust
I still hear the howling, I still feel the rush
Over the riots, above all the noise
Through all the worry, I still hear your voice


So, tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how ‘cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we will find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us


We used to be kids living just for kicks
In cinema seats, learning how to kiss
Running through streets that were painted gold
We never believed we'd grow up like this


So tell me how to be in this world
Tell me how to breathe in and feel no hurt
Tell me how 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
Tell me when the light goes down
That even in the dark we can find a way out
Tell me now 'cause I believe in something
I believe in us
I believe in something
And I believe in usNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNoneNone
I breathe in slow to compose myself
But the bleeding heart I left on the shelf
Started speeding 'round, beating half to death
'Cause you're here and you're all mine
So I press my lips down into your neck
And I stay there and I reconnect
Bravery I've been trying to perfect
It can wait for a while


Scared of the hope in my head
It's been making me sweat, but it turns out
You're here with your head on my chest
I should've guessed


The world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete


I breathe out now and we fall back in
Just like before we can re-begin
Let your lungs push slow up against my skin
Let it all feel just fine


Gone is the emptiness
We just take what's best and we move on
All of the hurt gets left
I should've guessed


That the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete
This, here, now, it's where we touch down
You and me, let's be incomplete


How'd we ever go without?
I don't know, but it looks like we've made it again
Tell me you'll never look down, down
And the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incom...


I don't wanna look down
I don't want us to break up in the clouds
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now
I don't wanna look down
I don't want us to break up in the clouds
All I want is to stay us, to stay with you now


And the world will turn and we'll grow
We'll learn how to be
To be incomplete

I'm fed up with this profile
I don't sleep, I'm obsessed
I get worn out by my words
'Cause they sounded so good in my head


I'm confused and I'm lonely
So is everyone else
Where are you in this ocean
Of static and nothing much else?


I swear I got somethin' worth heart
I know you could find it


Say that you can see me, I'll speak up I swear
But I need a second light
Now that you exist, I'm in your atmosphere

I'm gonna get you in my head, in my head, in my head
I'm gonna get you in my head 'til I can't forget


I feel so lost in this city
In all its traffic and tricks
As if we didn't have enough
Of our own problems to fix


And now we're lost and lonely
I'll be lost 'til you want me
Take me home, take me home, take me home
I'll go

'Cause you only text me after 2
I wanna just be done with you
But I call you back 'cause I'm a fool
Come get me when your promises come true
Until then I'll keep driving out to you


You say nothing all night
I'm back burning, don't lie
All night, all night
You give me nothing, act shy
Tell your friends, I don't mind
All night, all night
Then we get drunk and repeat


If I got a little higher, every time our plans fell through
I could touch the moon
You try so hard to play this bullshit game
One night you even straight forgot my name


You say nothing all night
I'm back burning, don't lie
All night, all night
You give me nothing, act shy
Tell your friends, I don't mind
All night, all night

You only love me in the fade out
You only call me when no one's around
You only want me when the lights are down
You only love me in the fade out
You only love me in the fade out
You only call me when no one's around
You only want me when the lights are down
You only love me in the fade out

I let you play me
I let you fade me out
It's happened again, it's happened again, it's happened again
I let you play me
I let you play me outNone
Drifting apart, getting harder to hold you
Days getting dark and the nights are growing cold
Are we burning out?
Swept out of sight, rolling out on an ocean
Let's cut all the ropes and get lost in the moment
If our hearts are alive, maybe then they might
Send us back to the sun


Now I know, I know
We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire
Fire


Heading down, heading underground feeling wasted
Cold to the bone, so alone I can taste it
Let's light it up
Street's are alive now and everything's bracing
You're on my mind, running in my veins
Fueling the flame, let's start it again (start it again)


Now I know, I know
We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before
When we were on fire

We were on fire
Fire, oh


Oh woah-oh oh woah-oh oh
Now don't tell me no, that we're burning down
Oh woah-oh oh woah-oh oh
And don't tell me no, that we're burning now


Cause I know, I know
That we're losing light and our love is dying
Take, take me home
Back to where it was before
When we were on fire
Fire


Now I know, I know
We're losing light, our love is dying
Out cold on the floor
Like a fallen star that shines no more
Take, take me back to where it was before

Fire
When we were on fire

I know I'll do it again
I know we're gonna collide
I know we'll call it the end
But it's always always a lie
You wear your heart on your sleeve
I wear my blood on my tie
But it's only love underneath, this disguise


Oh you left, a hole in me
I don't cut, easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
I think it's time to open up, I don't mean bleed
So turn it on, we can go wild
If it's what you want, fire at me


I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night, than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go


Why don't we do it again?
Go wrecking something of mine
Like you deserve the revenge
Like I've got something to hide
I keep on playing with you, yeah
You keep on calling me names
Sure I can take the abuse
It's just a game


Oh you left, a hole in me
I don't cut, easily
I'm only just holding up, on my knees
I think it's time to open up, I don't mean bleed
So turn it on, we can go wild
If it's what you want, fire at me


I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night, than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you go


All I know is I love it when, she blows
We keep turning red
Hot, stone cold, she burn inside
Deals get broke we fold in and fold out, we're too close
It's dead love until curtains close
And we come alive


I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night, than never have you in my life
I can't whoa no oh

I can't bear to let you go
So keep on throwing your sticks and stones
I'd rather fight with you all night, than never have you in my life
I can't bear to let, bear to let you goNoneNoneNone
When my heart is ready to burst
When the world spins in reverse
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong


When you go to turn down the light
And no one's there to hold you in the night
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong


When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home


When our picture fades in the Sun
And all the colors blur into one
I'll keep running
To the place where I belong


When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home


When your hope gets blinded
When you fold with the cards
No, I'll never stop fighting
To get to where you are


Wherever we go
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
Wherever we go
Wherever we go


When the lights are faded to black
And only stars are guiding me back
I'll keep running
To the place I belong


When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home
When you think you're on your own
I'm still coming home
Between the streets, before the night
I find you all alone
Shaking tired, but looking lost
I came to take you home
And we walk in silence
Side by side


And I just wanna lay you down
Your burdens, all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets
Whispered in my ear
Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart


The window's cold against your hand
Outside is just a blur
I pull you close, close your eyes
And we don't say a word
We've got to keep ruling, ruling


And I just wanna lay you down
Your burdens, all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets
Whispered in my ear
Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heart


We walk in silence
Side by side


And I just wanna lay you down
Your burdens, all your fears
And I don't need your deepest secrets
Whispered in my ear
Cause I can hear your heart, your heart
I can hear your heart, your heartNoneNone
I've been looking all night watching them empty hours
Invisible to these crowds, always double vision
I've been losing my mind listening to broken speech
Stacking up broken seats, it's a lonely picture


And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said


Get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can ooh ooh


As I'm sweeping up glass, I see the exit lights so green
These people falling into the streets
Something comes together
I've been here too long and if I stay, they'll tie me down
I know this trench won't hang around
So I'm gone forever


And I hear your voice as it echoes 'round my head
Always that same thing that you said


So get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can ooh ooh


Packing up my suitcase, racing down for gun street
Making my tracks along the cracks in the coke
Seeing those headlights shining down upon my feet
If you find me, you will find me on the run
For all the bleeding hearts pushing 'round the stubborn cards
I've seen the green of glass
I've seen the faster cars
And I don't need your heavy hours
I don't need your lonely bars
I'm ejected like a bullet from a gun
So take your final look at me, maybe even take my hand
Standing on the staircase, come and chase the master plan
Long way to get away, play it like a grand slam
This is no encore, we have only just begun


Get out, get out, while you still can
Don't let the nights slip through your hands
The world is wide from where you stand
So get out, get out while you still can ooh ooh


Ooh ooh ooh ooh...
Sorry ma'am, excuse me, excuse me
Hey!
Hey
What's up?
Uh, nothing
Really?
OK, what's going on in your head? You're like, being weird
I don't... I don't know how I... I feel about... this... us
Is it me or you?
No, it isn't you. Um, you should go
No. Come on, let's go back
Let's not wake up
We can just stay
You wanna walk home?
Yes, I wanna walk home
I hate when you do this
Oh, hey
Hey, can I um...
YeahWhen the time gets right
I'm gonna pick you up
And take you far way
From trouble my love
Under a big ol' sky
Out in a field of green
There's gotta be something left for us to believe

Oh, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the kings highway

No you can't hide out
In a six gun town
We wanna hold our heads up
But we gotta stay down
I don't wanna end up
In a room all alone
Don't wanna end up someone
That I don't even know

Lover, I await the day
Good fortune comes our way
And we ride down the Kings Highway
I can't shake this feeling
At the end of each day
That I keep on working hard
But all I do is get payed
Though I keep believing
There's a light up ahead
Cause it's only getting darker
And I could stay in my bed


It's a fight, it takes so long
But I've learned to hold my own


So I stand and I wait in line
With a heavy head and this bottle of wine
And I watch as they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line


I walk home in the shadows
I carry my cage
And I hope they notice
What I brought to the stage


Cause its a fight and it takes so long
But I've learned to hold my own


So I stand and I wait in line
With a heavy head and this bottle of wine
And I watch as they steal my time
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line


Ooh whenever it gets inside
It gets so hard to hide
Whenever it gets inside
Ooh I know you'll turn out right
Giving it all my life
I know you'll turn out right


And I stand and I wait in line
With a heavy head and this bottle of wine
And I vow as they steal my time
I know one day I'll get mine
And I stand here and wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
I stand and I wait in line
If I told you about my favorite dream
The one without you
Would you spit fire at me
Or would you burn to know
Every single by blow?

I don't know her
Maybe she isn't real
She didn't hold back
When you were lying next to me
This can't be all we are
Silent and in the dark


We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fight


Come a little closer
Remember when we used to sway
Trembling in the covers
Taking it with an only grey
This can't be all we are
Silent and in the dark


We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fight


No, I never saw the walls falling on us like this
Now I'm hanging from a rope holding my hope, my hope
I don't need it, I just want it more than anything else
I can't do this alone, no, no


We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we don't ignite, don't ignite
We could be making sparks
But we need to fight, need to fightNoneHey you!
Remember me? Remember love?
Remember trying to stay together?
My time, you took it all
You tried to see
You tried to bring yourself up without involving me
It isn't fair, to have your way
To try and get up and go and na na na na now can't you see
It isn't fair to have your way
But I'm trying to get your attention and I need you to know that

Hey you! Hey you!
Can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, now I know, I know know know

Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye

Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

I don't want to turn around
So come on baby
Come on and try to let it out
Let go
We're still the same
So come on baby
Trigger the sound, lets figure it out
Let's get back to where we started out

Hey you! Hey you!
Can't you make this sane?
I know, I know, I know you ain't the one to play the game
Now I know I'm never gonna go your way
If you go, now I know, I know know know

Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight
If you say the word then I'll say goodbye

Forever I see you and me
Forever I'll try for you and I
No I never believed in their insight
Just another good reason to get it right

Go go go go get out, get out of my memory
No no no not tonight, I don't have the energy

Go go go go get out, get out of my memory
No no no not tonight, oh not tonight, oh not tonight

Forever we tried to make it right
Together we saw the end in sight
I'm tired of fighting the good fight

Saw you today after so much time
It felt just like it used to be
Talking for hours about a different life
Surrounded us in memories
We were close, never close enough
Where are we now?
If it's torn, we can stitch it up
Don't rule it out, oh no no


I'll come around if you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love, I'll come around


Wanted to ask if we could have been
But my tongue wouldn't break the seal
You always had something effortless
In school, you were the biggest deal
Little cuts close and open up
Time is slipping by
Always thinking 'bout the two of us
You play on my mind, always playing on my mind


I'll come around if you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love, I'll come around


We were young, we were side by side
Don't know when we started losing touch
If you want, we can walk a while
Maybe that would be enough
Used to talk, drink into the night
I would wake up on the front room floor
All alone you'd be in my bed, made me crazy
Made me want you more


I'll come around if you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting but I'm willing if you call me up
I'll come around if you ever want to be in love
I'm not waiting but I'm willing if you call me up
If you ever want to be in love, I'll come aroundNoneNone

Time keeps on coming
I've been all around
I’ll keep on running
Till time catches on
I've been on the run


Now you're back in your hideout
Never gave it all for free
Everyone was talking to ya, to ya


Time keeps on learning
About you and me
I’ll keep on loving
Someday she'll love me
I'll love you for free


Now your heart has been broken
And you're miles off away
Now you can't find the right words to say


Once uphill you'll be fine
But your love's lost down the line
Hate to say I was wrong
Came into this life on my own
And I'll try, yes I’ll try
Hope for love, turn out the light
And I gave my own life, my own life, my own life


He’ll treat you unkindly
If that's what you want
But you’ll stay inside me
Inside of my heart
Unbound at the start


Now your heart has been broken
And you're miles off away
Now you can't find the right words to say


Once uphill you'll be fine
But your love’s lost down the line
Hate to say I was wrong
Came into this life on my own
And I'll try, yes I'll try
Hope for love, turn out the light
And I gave my own life, my own life, my own life
Asleep with the morning light
Walking you home
Found you in the garden with
Pockets of gold
I forgot the future and the time


Would you be the only one
In my life with my love?
I've been running


And you help me realize
There ain't much time in life before the lights go down
So I want to tell you now


You're laying in my white bed
Sleeping in my thoughts
On a trip to Carcassonne where
Our dreams won't get lost
I forgot the past and all its woes


Would you be the only one
In my life with my love?
I've been running


And you help me realize
There ain't much time in life before the lights go down
So I want to hold you now


For a few weeks I'll be obligated to play my songs and travel on the road
All I want when I get back home is to see your face and lie with you alone
I'll do my best to show you
How much I want to know you
To know you


Your grandma and grandpa give
You all of their love
I want to stay beside you through
These times that are tough
I can't always trust what's on my mind but I know


You could be the only one
In my life with my love
I've been running


And you help me realize
There ain't much time in life before the lights go down
So I want to know you now
Yeah I want to know you now
I want to know you now
Oh, thought I'd go and leave
Anyway time recalls
All your life, all your life, all your life
All your life, all your life, all your life, all your life


Oh, you can't believe
That a match dipped in gasoline
Has the power to lift you from this dream
One I thought to leave


Now I'll go and lead
Anyway time recalls
All your life, all your life, all your life
All your life, all your life, all your life, all your life


Oh, the pills were green
And I swallowed them inside a sea of mercury
Then the fire came and burned your mind
And drowned you deep
When I thought to leave


Anyway time recalls
All your life, all your life, all your life
All your life, all your life, all your life, all your life


Oh, the noose was clean
As I swung it on the blade on high, the fan did gleam
And it's revolutions turned my mind back indeed
When I thought to leave


Anyway time recalls
All your life, all your life, all your life
All your life, all your life, all your life, all your life
All your life, all your life, all your life, all your life
Lost my name
Thought you found your own way
Knew you'd find it some day


Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up
Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up


Breathe in slow with the sun and the rain
Lit the fire in your brain
Cannabis, DMT, dimethyltryptamine


Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up
Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up


Your mind has waved so long
Now you know that you're truly gone


Lost my name
With the answer you'll take
And the question you'll make


Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up
Won't you elongate the time
To open both our minds up


Your mind has waved so long
Now you know that you're truly goneNoneNoneNoneNone
All the light came on my way
From a once familiar face
Thought the love was here to stay


I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you
I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you
I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you


Have you come to pacify?
Let the haze enclose your mind
Just the way you pass the time


I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you
I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you
I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you


All the visions came in from the east and from the north
Future is the past and it's still knocking at your door
I could see you now
I saw my friend
She called my name
Or you propose the question to the history of refrain


Do you miss the time at all?
Had a thought leave as I fall
To make eyes and close the door


I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you
I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you
I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you


All the visions came in from the east and from the north
Future is the past and it's still knocking at your door
I could see you now
I saw my friend

All the light came on my way
From a once familiar face
Thought the love was here to stay

I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you
I could be wrong if I think I'll forget about you
When the light revealed the dream
Opened the door
Hoping to lean
And I gave my own life
And I gave it all to the wind


All for love
Gave that a try
Head on the floor
Most of the time
And I gave my own life
And I gave it all to the wind


Love
Loving is a new part of
And up until today I seemed to get away
I can see the stars above
Swirling around to say
Out went the light
As I leapt through the door
And I followed it home
And I didn't know why
I didn't know why


All the nights I'd been afraid
Living life just to fade away
But all the light laying in your eyes
Left me stunned in a pale surprise
Woke up within that morning just to turn back time
And get back in line


Her old man's driving the whip
Too much to bear
Rolled up a spliff
And I gave my own life
And I gave it all to the wind


Quite the type to treat you unkind
And take all your love
Most of the time
And I gave my own life
And I gave it all to the wind


Love
Loving is a new part of
And up until today I seemed to get away
I can see the stars above
Swirling around to say
Out went the light
As I leapt through the door
And I followed it home
And I didn't know why
I didn't know why


All the nights I'd been afraid
Living life just to fade away
But all the light laying in your eyes
Left me stunned in a pale surprise
Woke up within that morning just to turn back time
And get back in line
Looking all around for someone new
Up and down and right in front of you
Staring in the mirror is all you do
Tell me how long
Tell me how long


Who opened up my mind?
Haze took me so high


Could you be my, could you be my
Could you be my love?
Could you be my, could you be my
Would you be my love?


No one knew how long they had
Shot me down or shoot another man
Caught inside such a familiar trap
Tell me how long
Tell me how long


Who opened up my mind?
Haze took me so high


Could you be my, could you be my
Could you be my love?
Could you be my, could you be my
Would you be my love?


How did you know
How to carry this song
Opened up after closing so long
Now you're right and nobody's wrong


Could you be my, could you be my
Could you be my love?
Could you be my, could you be my
Would you be my love?
We waited for the day to come
But if the day never shows his face
To you
When you're in the mood
To be lifted off your two feet


Oh it's just a vision
Someone you believe in
You're in conversation
With someone who's slowly fading away


We waited for the outcome
Even though the ebb and flow
Is not
Something you control a lot
To be lifted off your two feet


Oh it's just a vision
Someone you believe in
You're in conversation
With someone who's slowly fading away

{Bridge]
Thought the day
Was miles away
Then it came and blew you all away
It's alright
Just don't forget to lock the door
And say goodnight


We waited for the day to come
But if the day never shows his face
To you
When you're in the mood
To be lifted off your two feet


Oh it's just a vision
Someone you believe in
You're in conversation
With someone who's slowly fading awayNoneNoneNot once
But twice
Walked into my life
And left
To find what you want

Back with
Your man
Who dresses up like John Lennon
And sings in
A Beatles cover band

He's drunk
You're too
He'll pull back
And hurt you
Fears just like a nightmare
To me

All the conti's far down the line
Have let in abuse of all kinds
Feels familiar and justifies
A sad urge to sabotage your own life
Now you think you're living it right
But you're not when you blow out a good man's light

You're a
Liar
On sale
For hire
But we know you work for free
Selfish
So true
Feel like I don't know you
And I never knew myself

I still
Love you
And I'd do anything to
Help you
Feel more at ease
To my own detriment
In codependent affluence
Comfortable
Living in a dream
All day
Felt it in the fallen rain
You believe
You believe in something till you can't dream
Open up your arms
Now you may comfort me
Me all the time


All day
Felt just like a fallen wave
You believe
You believe in something till you can"t speak
Open up your mouth
Now you may comfort me
Me all the time


All the time has made it so hard for you
Given more than you thought to use


All day
Felt it in the solemn way
You believe
You believe in something til' you can't dream
Open up your arms
Now you may comfort me
Me all the time


All the time has made it so hard for you
Given more than you thought to useNoneNoneWanderer
Just like a song
That's been rubbed out above your left arm
Full of light
Eager eyes
For the adventure of a lifetime

She's on the run
Who you running from?
It can't be me cause I'm no one
Turtle dove
Carried my love
And left it on the moon to shine

I'll try
My best to find some peace of mind
But the light fades to black
And you don't know where the exit is at

Wanderer
Labyrinthine fern
Planted in your dilated mind
Evil talk
Heaven above
Protect her in her darkest night
On my way and I had to lie
How's it going; I'm doing fine
And I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home


Here's a friend that you can't ignore
Fight breaks out then I'm out the door
And I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home


Oh no
It's in your eyes
You'll never be the same
But I'm on my way home
Yes I'm on my way home
Yes I'm on my way home


Up for show then the stage went black
Lit the joint then I hit the sack
And I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home


Caught the flight, and I lost my name
Transatlantic, I hope today
That I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home


Oh no
It's in your eyes
You'll never be the same
But I'm on my way home
Yes I'm on my way home
Yes I'm on my way home


Here we stand in the customs line
He says you're packing; I'll pull you back
And I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home


Detained now and I'm feeling low
Hoping some day they'll let me go
And I'm on my way home
I'm on my way home


Oh no
It's in your eyes
You'll never be the same
But I'm on my way home
Yes I'm on my way home
Yes I'm on my way home
Have you heard of a friend
Trying so hard to pretend
Oh no I gave too much
Felt elated by the touch


I've been dreaming
Of the moon
And what good comes for you


Caught in a wind so fast
Here's another for the past
They'll try to take your light
What they want most is a fight


I've been dreaming
Of the moon
And what good comes for you


When the morning sings it's song
And the evening comes along
And we kneel beside the fire
Now you know your desireNoneNoneNone
I'm waiting for
You to come down
From the high
That you found
I'm waiting for
You to let go
And find your old hope


It was the best piece of you
That came in from the rain
It was the best piece of love
That came in to say


I'm waiting for
You to come down
From the high
That you found
I'm waiting for
You to let goNoneNoneNoneNone
He's a dad
So they say
But I won't
What's a man
I don't care
I know I'm not one


Waken up only to rise again
Dreams of unity have faded


Turning around to see
There's a head
In the back
Looking at me
Lit a fire
In the kiln
Make somebody
To watch over me
I tried to think
As the light
Bounces around from time to time
You had a dream
That you share
With us frequently


Thinking you were someone else
When you were only yourself
Is it enough?


You gave up
On the dream
Separating you from everything
Will you try
And bend the lie
Saying that things are just fine


Saying you were somewhere else
When you were by yourself
Tucked in at homeNone
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you


Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight




Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonightNoneNone
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink


Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"


I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face


I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived


So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"


Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"


I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl


You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me


You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl


And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night


She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she’s wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing


I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream


So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I’m gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me


He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name—hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same


I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don’t wake up, this love is like a dream

Push up on me and sweat, darling

And won’t stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me (Rrrat)
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me


Bardi, uh
You never live 'til you risk your life (Life)
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice (Ice, ice, oh)
Am I your lover or I’m just your vice? (Woo, yeah, yeah)
A little crazy, but I'm just your type (Okurrr)
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, in my closet, his and hers, ayy
He want the lil' mamacita, margarita (Margarita)
I think that Ed got a lil' jungle fever, ayy (Woo!)
You are more than (You are more than)
Something borin' (Something borin')
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh (Uh)
Go explore in (Woo, woo) somethin' foreign (Skrrt, skrrt)
Bust it up, a rain forest, it be pourin', yeah
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me (Never leave me)
You got a girl that could finally do it all
Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh


So join me in this bed (This bed) that I'm in (That I'm in)

I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see


I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow


I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser


Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser


And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraserNoneNoneNone
Nah nah nah nah nah


I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me


I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me


But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you


We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you


We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too




Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me tooNoneNone
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me


I sing, "I write my own tune and I write my own verse," hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man


All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady


You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough


You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me




My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning


Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!


Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you




Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea


Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day


Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man


I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator


Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu


Cool…
Give me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go


And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya


Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow


Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, give me love


Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go


You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya


Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself


I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself


But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myselfNone
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now


I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now


Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take


And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better nowNoneNone
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us


And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach


I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop


And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach


And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now? (And I feel love)
For how long-long I love my lover?

I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind


This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in


I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover


Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind


This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in


All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line

Calling out across the line (and I saw scars upon her)

I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No


I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now


Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now


Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No


My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow
Igh!NoneNone
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too


But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself


Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you


I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet


But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself


'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you


With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum


Baby, the best part of me is you (Whoa)
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you (Oh)
Baby, I'm so in love with you (Yeah, yeah)
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life


I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right


You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes


And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right


You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe


'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right


You were just a small bump unborn
Just four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why

My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride (Ride), he shoot a guy (Guy)
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone


It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault  (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Whoa)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, travelled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now


Jet plane headed up to the sky (To the sky)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (Woop, woop)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (In a what?)
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low (Ceilin' low)
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome (When in Rome)
No town does it quite like my home (They don't)
So take me back to—


Birmingham, 0121 stand up!
You better tell them the hooligan's here
My team can't lose when I'm here
Outside, quick twos and a beer
You see me when I choose to appear
Just paid a few bag for my carpet
Blud, take off your shoes when you're here
Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Tiptronic man cruise through the gears
Rep blues when I'm here
It's Brum
Fam, are you dumb?
Red red wine or you want a redrum
You can be forty, you don't wanna war me
End of story, you're gunna get spun
Man smoke weed 'til my whole head's numb
Don't talk greaze cos I won't take none
VIP in my own section
Wild, wild west with the old western, it's Brum!


Old school raving, back to scally
And the AP, packed with gally
Take me back to Manny
Blacked out Roll full of yack and maggy
And a S3 boot full of packs of Cali
Hit the booth, man, slap it snappy
Bap bap, that's that, track wrapped, I'm happy
Some man are blessed, some are bad and trappy
Gets cold up north, pack your hat and trackie'
Huh, man was made to set pace
Young Aitch, I came for first place
Made a change to get paid
Fam, I stayed in my lane and came with that flame
Day to day we on stage
Make my K, then I skate and catch the next plane
Baking up when I wake
Rake it up, get it saved
It's make it or break


It's make it or break
Human man, still make a mistake
Mad now Aitch just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make the next eight
We 'bout to set pace, I can't get about no more it gets bait
And I don't get head no more, I get face
She don't want him no more, she wants Jay
And she don't want me no more, she wants Aitch (Aye)
Jaykae, make a lot of P (Uh)
Go straight there if that's where I've got to be
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G
5 million minimum, what I wanna see
I ain't in it for the money, put that to bed
Tell mumsy that I'm on a track with Ed
Aim this one at your head
Write bars with a pen on a pad when the battery's dead


Jet plane headed up to the sky (0161)
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high (0121)
We ain't hit a rave in a while (London City)
So take me back to London (Woo)
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome
No town does it quite like my home (Like my home)
So take me back to LondonNone
Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true, I kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But  it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot?
I think not


I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore


Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with


I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore


And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change 
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest


I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?


So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to


So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


And oh, I know
And oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars
From America
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to


But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?


Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love


I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore


On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?


Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love


All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself


I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go


"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but


I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own


I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go


"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but


I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own


Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder


I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own
It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on


So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart


It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on


So live life like you’re giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my


I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone (Prr)
But they ain't got nothing on you (Ah, ah)
And you ain't got nothing on you (Leones Con Flow)


Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh (Yo'; ¡wuf!)
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa (Ey; wuh)
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar

And you ain't got nothing on you


Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah


I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do

She was like "Damn¨

Want to be your man
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you was booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in


She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly


Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back?
She put you in her brother's hands only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn


She's just under the upper hand
Goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly


An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line


Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police and
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
It's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the 6 inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point your life flashes before your eyes, your handbag's dropped
And all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that's caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her 13th birthday


And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
Cause in a pipe she'll fly to the motherland and
Sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
Angels to dieNoneNone
Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all


Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all


A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same


Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain


Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same


Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain


Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change


Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights


This the type of shit we used to dream of (Yeah, yeah)
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa (Mona Lisa)
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza (Splash, water)
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this


Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights


Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent (Woo)
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world


Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded (Gettin' faded)
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights


Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes


Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nightsNoneNone
Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin’ 'bout her


And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love


Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl


How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
’Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my


Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That’s the way to break my—


First love never dies
Guess I’ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember


Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don’t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love


Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?

Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing)
I waited most my life for somethin' real (You done knocked me right off of my feet)
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel (Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo)
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy


Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real

Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers (Alright)
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas (Nah)
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin (Alright)
This love give you protein and vitamin (Yeah)
See you wigglin', jigglin' (Mmm)
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? (One)
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean


Baby, I got the feels, yeah (Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing

You’re not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I’m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her


I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear


When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you


She was mine
I was hers and all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be

Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
If you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scarred and left me, like a sunburn

I still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rappping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this


You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
X2
You need me


I said you need 3 man I don't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
I qualified for everything, long straight season
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it




You need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall
Like autumn, check my post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
But now the clock's aviated
Everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
Cause I get respected
While they get detested
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a line

None
She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke


You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to


I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep


Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to


'Cause I love the way you wake me up
And for goodness sake, will my love not be enough?


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two


The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow


London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home (Woo!)


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two


And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along


London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home


I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you

Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone


It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault (Oh)
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour (Oh)
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? (Oh)
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael (Woah)
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, travelled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now

You see me when I choose to appear
Just paid a few bags for my carpet

Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Tiptronic man cruise through the gears
Rep blues when I'm here

Made a change to get paid

Rake it up, get it saved
It's make it or break


It's make it or break
Human man, still make a mistake
Mad now Aitch just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make the next eight
We 'bout to set pace'

Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left


I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe


(Knock knock knock) on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing


Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babeLetra de "Shape Of You (Remix)" ft. Zion & Lennox
El club no es el mejor sitio para encontrar el amor, no, no, no
Yo me jugaría todo para que conmigo se dé un shot, ven a ver
Yo llegué solo en busca de ti
Ya me imagino lo que vamo' a hacer
Sé que andas sola en busca de mí, yo lo sé


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, uhmmm, uhmmm


I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body


Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I

Y yo vine a darte placere'
Eres la más linda, la que mis ojos quieren
La que mi cuerpo prefiere
Dame, dame de eso, mamacita
Yo quiero más de ti
Dame de tu cuerpo que me excita
Dejaste mi cama oliendo a ti


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me

Sólo sígueme, sígueme"

Last night you were n my room (zu)
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I’d never leave her
But now I’m ready to go
And strange as it seems
She’s endless to me
She’s just like paperwork
But harder to read


Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself


I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn’t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way


Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself


And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
"Won’t you stay?" She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I’ll stay, anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah


And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me

And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah


When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet, yeah


It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah


Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because


My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time


Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it


Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because


My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time


Oh baby, baby, how was I supposed to know?
Oh, pretty baby, I shouldn't've let you go


Oh, I must confess, that my loneliness is killing me now
Hit me baby one more time


My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
When I'm not with you, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey


I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do


But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved


I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey


I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do


But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush

Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance?
Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence
Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man


I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone


Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself


And we’ve got that love in us and we're the drink killers
We’re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers
If we talk outside, say "Hey what's new?"
I don’t really dance so I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here, I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off what you’re wearing






She’s like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need


Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself


Across the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me


So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose



I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me


I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"


And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
One, two, three


Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear, dear


Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you


I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you


Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;
See what's going on


And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you


I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you


Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road


'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you
And I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, now it seems you loved me too
I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes


Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes


It's only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
Only been one night of love
Maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyesNone
I didn't mean to break your heart, I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight?
I wish I never called you up, and nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight?


And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah


Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want


I never meant to sleep around, I was just lonely
And you did the same, again and again and again, whoa I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight


And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah


Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want


When I see my future, it is with you
And we’ll get there
And I want my children to be with you
And we’ll get there


Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want


Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you areNoneNoneNone
You give me life and a loss of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go


And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss


So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now


And you speak to me behind your darkened stare
And you let me be as if I wasn't there


It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue


It's you I miss
And it's you I miss, oh-oh


So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now


It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue


Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue

So let it out
I let it out now

She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day


And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high


We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you


When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day

And it's cold outside again
And we're still so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you

And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like

We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York, that is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio, passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you
